this must be do in a harmonised manner and at international level .
only in this way can obscure and illegal practice be trace and penalise more easily because - and this appear to I to be the key problem - the discrepancy between the legal and illegal arm trade be become increasingly small .
the globalisation of world trade make arm cheap , more readily available and more difficult to trace .
accord to oxfam , fifty - five percent of the total trade in light weapon be illegal .
needless to say , a strict code of conduct only make sense if the member state assume their own share of the responsibility .
in certain air- and seaport , arm control leave a great deal to be desire .
in addition , cooperation with candidate country must be step up in this area .
they may subscribe to the code , but in certain case act as the hub of the illegal arm trade .
some will claim that the code of conduct be not ambitious enough , but it be well to have a code of conduct which be flawed than not to have one at all .
in any event , future annual report should contain more complete and transparent information , and the code of conduct should become legally bind in due course .
this code of conduct be a first step in the direction of great coherence , but I share the rapporteur & apos ; s hope that we will not leave it at that .
mr president , the real solution to the whole problem of arm export and arm production be that we should convert to non - weapon production .
we be in the 21st century now .
the technology and expertise that be available should be use for something constructive in society , something that will benefit people rather than something that be go to annihilate and destroy people .
we should be focus on the conversion to non - weapon production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapon manufacturing country around the world .
country with very few resource and very little money be coerce and force into buy weapon when they should be use that money for social and health problem in their own country instead of contribute to insecurity in the region and in many case to the abuse of their own people with these weapon .
we only have to look at indonesia and the fact that the european union could not wait to lift the arm embargo , or to not reinstate it .
that be deplorable .
if you look at the other country in europe which be now getting involve in the arm industry it be extremely disturbing .
I come from ireland , which have a track record of non - weapon production and no involvement in the arm industry .
now I find that contract for arm and component for arm be increase every year .
in northern ireland , where there be a so - call peace process one of the big company that have come there and be welcome with open arm be raytheon one of the big arm manufacturer in the world .
that be a complete contradiction in term .
we should tackle this .
we should keep the arm industry out .
that be not where we should be provide job .
we should be provide job for people in something that be constructive and positive for society .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the fact that we be debate the code of conduct be a positive step .
nonetheless , several legitimate question arise .
be it possible for those who use their weapon in yugoslavia to murder civilian , destroy building and bridge , and cause irreparable destruction to the environment , and those who murder , and continue to murder , child in iraq , to be really interested in arm control ?
be it possible for those who acknowledge that the european arm industry be important both economically and strategically to be sincere when they say that the external action of the european union must be inspire by the value of democracy and the protection of human right ?
rather , as have already be say , they be far more concerned that their weapon will end up in the wrong hand , or that their act of aggression will accept enemy fire from weapon they have make themselves .
but the weapon be already in the wrong hand , and we would be delude ourselves if we believe that procedure such as the code of conduct could put a stop to the act of aggression and crime of the new order of thing .
we be convinced that the existence of the code of conduct be not the result of the philanthropic feeling of those who inspire it , but of the intensify resistance of people against the barbarity of imperialism .
we place our hope for a world without conflict and weapon in the universal , peaceful and , more generally , popular movement .
mr president , special attention deserve to be pay to the european parliament & apos ; s first report on the export of arm since the member state adopt a code of conduct on this matter in 1998 .
if the european union & apos ; s action beyond its border be to be coherent in the way that the european parliament never tire of ask that it should be , must not the priority of the arm - export state , in a sphere ultra - sensitive to public opinion , be that of simultaneously pay attention to human right , conflict prevention and the european union & apos ; s external security ?
our rapporteur , mr titley , be propose a bold resolution to parliament .
he emphasise the entirely inadequate nature of the code of conduct which , it should be remember , be non - binding .
the code ought therefore to be make legally binding .
control must be tighten up , and the ultimate use to which export arm be put must be strictly monitor in a word , the trade in death must stop .
the supervisory mechanism must above all be extend to the light , small calibre arm use in a great many regional and ethnic conflict throughout the world , which be often turn against the civil and military personnel of eu country .
finally , mr titley propose cooperate with the united states - and why not , I might add , with russia and china too ? - in order to devise a common approach to conventional arm export control similar to that establish for chemical weapon control .
the five permanent member of the security council , who be suppose to watch over our security , should listen to these proposal and negotiate an arrangement truly worthy of the twenty - first century as quickly as possible .
mr president , I fully share the hope and the opinion of mrs morgantini and mr brie , whose first amendment clearly state that the union & apos ; s aim must not merely be to establish a code of conduct on arm export , but to work for international disarmament and to end the arm race altogether .
this should be the european union & apos ; s fundamental objective .
whatever the case , arm export exist and it be therefore useful and it be a step forward to have a code of conduct on arm export , which sometimes run counter to the principle that should be the identify feature of the european union : conflict prevention and the defence of human right .
we should therefore take this opportunity to make the code more efficient and to ensure that our young soldier engage in peace mission do not have to confront , as they occasionally do , arm export by the european union .
there be four issue which we should examine thoroughly .
mr president , I believe that the titley report and the code of conduct , which we be debate together today , be two initial step in the right direction . of course , we must regard they as just a starting - point .
I would like to make a few general point , which I think may contribute to the debate .
the arm trade be characterise by the fact that the major purchaser be poor country , which seem to be able to find the money for arm but not for anything else .
this should trouble we , since the money come from smuggling , from the sale of drug and from a compliant banking system . but the sale of weapon be often make easy by the dealer themselves .
I believe that it be not enough for we to seek out the end user .
we must seek out the producer , who must be make to defend themselves and to explain what they have do with their entire weapon production , because usually weapon smuggling start with the producer and not with any other sector .
I would like to add that , in addition to the country of the european union , all the country of central and south - eastern europe that have close tie with the eu , cyprus , canada and other have contribute to this positive development .
we can not take practical decision base on false information and distorted reality .
this relate to the specific statement make about turkey & apos ; s behaviour in this regard .
mr president , I do not know whether to laugh or to recoil in horror at this report .
if it be adopt , it would show up the european parliament for what it be and for what it be good for .
the report even have the temerity to present arm export as a means of prevent conflict , combat poverty and promote human right .
the weapon use to target and kill a palestinian child in cold blood be no doubt a product of the duly regulate , ethical arm trade , as no doubt be the bomb drop upon the former yugoslavia and the fragmentation mine leave in africa .
give that armament be the flagship product of international trade and a huge source of profit for a number of large industrial group which like to think they be respectable , the only role leave to the european parliament be that of attach the fig leaf of hypocrisy to the traffic in arm and the loathsome state of affair which enable it to thrive .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
separate financial control function
mr president , I be pleased to see so many member of the public here today because , as everyone up there can see , there be very few people down here at this time of night .
today & apos;s debate mark an important step in the reform process that be initiate by the prodi commission just over one year ago .
it be the very first legislative proposal to be consider by this house as part of the reform package .
the proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flow directly from the recommendation formulate last year by the committee of independent expert , which parliament endorse in my report of 19 january of this year .
this draft legislation be more important to the future of the commission than its less than thrilling title suggest .
in its first report the committee of independent expert state that internal control and internal audit be entirely separate - even conflict - activity , which do not belong in the same department .
they reach the conclusion that a priori control and internal auditing be activity which employ completely different technique and address completely different concern .
the arrangement whereby they have be keep together within the same dg should be review .
internal auditing must play an effective support role in the service of the commission so that the latter can exercise its responsibility .
with that aim in view , the human resource allocate to internal auditing should be greatly increase .
in addition , internal auditing must take its place independently .
the court of auditor take the same view in 1997 , when it write that there be a latent conflict between the power to grant approval - and thus expenditure - and the responsibility for subsequently evaluate the same expenditure in accordance with the criterion for sound financial management .
the commission & apos;s fast - track proposal seek to implement the recommendation of the committee of independent expert by create an internal auditor who operate separately and independently from the financial controller .
I have no doubt that its implementation will be one of the key to the success of the reform package announce by vice - president kinnock in april .
I be proud of the fact that the committee on budgetary control have be able to agree unanimously on a draft opinion within a very short period of time .
many thank , therefore , to the other member of the committee for their help and in particular to mr dell & apos;alba , whose work as rapporteur for the committee on budget prove invaluable .
let we hope that the council will now take a leaf out of our book and develop the same sense of urgency .
while our committee welcome the broad gist of the commission & apos;s proposal , my report present a number of change which must be make in order to make the propose separation of power work .
I can not help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the reform white paper , the commission fail to focus properly on the detail .
the change propose by our committee be design to clarify the commission & apos;s text , to impose certain minimum reporting standard and to tailor the text more closely to the specific circumstance of the different european institution , all of which be affect by any change to the financial regulation .
first , the division of responsibility between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarify .
it be not enough to state that an internal auditor must be appoint .
the financial regulation must also contain a job description .
our committee & apos;s amendment seek to draw a clear distinction between the role of the financial controller who remain responsible for ex ante financial control , and the internal auditor , who be responsible for ex post control , and in particular reporting on the quality of management and control system .
secondly , the commission & apos;s proposal would have the effect of make the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institution .
while this make sense for an institution with a large operational budget or those with a relatively large administrative budget , such as the european parliament and the council , it do not necessarily make sense for the other small institution which have a financial control staff of no more than four .
while these institution must have the option of appoint an internal auditor , it be sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirement on the financial controller .
it must be clear , however , that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period .
when the recasting of the financial regulation be complete , hopefully within one to two year , it must apply fully to all institution .
some member of the committee have argue that the appointment of an internal auditor should be make compulsory for all institution at this stage .
of course such a notion have superficial appeal , but if it lead to the appointment of at least 20 additional official without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gain it should be resist .
it be important , however , that institution which do not employ an internal auditor take the job of internal audit seriously .
I be surprised to discover that in at least one of the small institution no audits be carry out by the financial controller despite the clear requirement to do so in the financial regulation .
the third change to the commission & apos;s proposal contain in my report be therefore the spelling out of a minimum reporting requirement .
one of the problem parliament have face in recent year be a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institution .
I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual report detail their activity .
finally , institution must learn from each other instead of constantly reinvent the wheel .
my report propose that the annual internal audit report produce in one institution should be make available to all other institution to enable they where appropriate to apply the conclusion arrive at elsewhere to their own management and control system .
as I have already remind the house , this proposal be only the prelude to a full recasting of the financial regulation .
parliament have not yet receive the official text of the proposal but we have be able to see a preliminary version of the text and although I hope the full text will be forward to parliament soon I also understand the commission & apos;s wish to ensure that the text be legally and linguistically watertight .
it be a very substantial document .
some in parliament have already refer to it as the & quot ; beast & quot ; , but it be go to be one of the most important item of legislation before we during the term of this parliament .
one of the key change advocate by the commission be the abolition of the system of ex ante financial control .
this proposal do not meet with unanimous approval in this parliament as , the commissioner well know .
many member be concerned that the exist system of financial control will disappear before a new system which now exist only on paper have be prove to work .
we have therefore ask the commission to give we an undertaking that during the transitional period which be about to begin the system of centralised ex ante control will be maintain and will not be affect by the introduction of the internal audit function .
I would ask the commission to confirm today the undertaking it have already give parliament in relation to this point .
I would , however , like to make my personal point of view very clear .
I welcome the propose change in principle .
as the committee of independent expert point out last year , most of the irregularity highlight by the committee stem from decision approve by the financial controller , that the suppose quality guarantee provide by the approval be a myth and put forward two strong argument for change the system .
first , ex ante checking , whether it be universal or base on sampling , be unlikely to be a cost - effective process .
the effort put into check all transaction be clearly disproportionate , while sample be unlikely to have sufficient deterrent effect .
the second and fundamental principle be that any retention of ex ante control run up against the crucial objection that , de facto if not de jure , it displace responsibility for financial regularity from the person actually manage expenditure to the person approve it .
although the court of auditor have never explicitly back abolition of centralised ex ante financial control and we have yet to hear its view on the proposal at present before we , it have raise the possibility of move to a different system .
in its 1997 opinion it write : & quot ; as for completely abolish the requirement of prior approval , this would not be acceptable unless it be to be replace by other procedure that provide at least equivalent safeguard and that could also involve financial official other than the financial controller . & quot ;
the commission & apos;s challenge will be to convince parliament that it can create those safeguard .
mr president , this evening , we be discuss the tightening of control on expenditure by the european institution . an important topic , I might add , as europe have a bad reputation among its electorate in this area .
too much european money disappear to unknown destination , both at brussels level and within the member state . the objective of the commission proposal we be discuss today be to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function .
the van hulten report be right to define far the discrepancy put forward by the commission and set the right tone for exchange good practice among institution .
there might be some reservation with regard to the exception mr van hulten make in his report for small institution where the appointment of auditor be concern .
however , I can understand the pragmatic reasoning behind this idea .
I too believe that the staffing level in those institution be too low to warrant extra manpower .
I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular , namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control .
after all , these be administrative - official institution where the option of ex ante control remain an absolute necessity .
this do not mean that permission must be gain from the financial director for the purchase of every single pencil .
what it do mean , however , be that an assessment be carry out , accord to modern method on the basis of risk analysis , to find out in what case of expenditure ex ante control be absolutely essential .
it also mean that ex ante control must still be require when the service request this .
if this possibility be not to exist , this could lead to a situation in which people no long dare take decision .
also important be that the ex ante control continue to be carry out independently , admittedly in a decentralised manner , but certainly not under the director - general of the directorate - general under scrutiny .
in summary , independent audits be compulsory but can not be carry out without modern and efficient ex ante control . the two be strictly separate but jointly responsible for the sound supervision of the european institution & apo ; expenditure .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , the socialist group in this house support mr van hulten & apos ; s report and therefore also the unanimous decision and proposal from the committee on budgetary control .
so - nothing against an independent , internal audit service , to which we be give the green light today with mr van hulten & apos ; s report !
a professional audit be an essential component of modern management in the public and private sphere .
however , a good audit be not in itself a miracle cure .
I will not name any name here , but one could give a whole list of company where renowned auditing firm have attest that all be well , only to find a few week or month later that they have collapse .
that be why I find it worry that the commission be obviously still intend , as before , to introduce the new audit service not as a useful complementary service but as a substitute for the traditional financial control .
as previous speaker make clear , that mean it be on a head - on collision course with a majority in this parliament , which after all be responsible for scrutinise and assess the commission .
nor , unfortunately , be the independence of the new audit service beyond all doubt .
under the so - call fast - track procedure we be discuss today , the commission guarantee that independence , but the draft document on the general reform of the financial regulation , of which we already have a provisional version , be a step back again in that respect .
why , for instance , commissioner , do the commission not want to grant the internal auditor the power to initiate proceeding before the european court of justice in the event of his independence be impede ?
and be the independence of the internal auditor not also impede if - even before he be appoint - a fait accompli be establish by recruit his staff in advance ?
we have other example of where that lead .
we need only think of olaf .
here too the commission face the new director with a fait accompli by simply transfer the entire team of the former uclaf task force to olaf , even though it be clear that some of the official be totally unqualified for the job .
result : the new director may come from the outside , but he immediately find himself ensnare in a system that be already firmly establish .
I hope we will not see a repeat performance here !
I can understand the commission want to show that it can produce quick result ; but when you talk to commission official , you get the sense of a mood of grow depression over the past month , and not only among the so - call loser , for of course some people be bind to lose out in any reform .
like several member state , I think there be still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefit it will produce .
we be still start out from the simple idea that in the end the purpose of reform be to achieve great efficiency .
today we still do not know whether it will and until we do I would advise this house to take a rather sceptical view of the european commission & apos ; s reform process .
after all , we owe it to our voter !
mr president , commissioner , I would like to start by congratulate the rapporteur .
I have a feeling that these kind of topic , and this report , be right up his street , and I would almost go so far as to say that it be not a coincidence that this sitting be so well attend this evening .
the proposal under discussion be a direct result of the report by the committee of independent expert .
an internal control service be to be set up .
yet , my group feel it be too early at this stage to make a final decision on centralise ex ante control or decentralise ex ante control within the directorate - general themselves .
we need to give this some more thought and weigh up the pro and con very carefully .
I also believe that , as far as this be concern , we need the advice from the european court of auditor .
we can not make a decision until we have the proposal on the new financial regulation , and within the framework of the discussion on these new regulation , a number of aspect will need to be lay down definitively .
we will be back all amendment which help clarify the division between financial control and internal audits , as currently propose .
we be also in favour of provide information more effectively .
in our view , there be one note of discord in the report , although this be not the view of the entire group , and that be the question : should internal control only be set up in respect of the commission , the council and parliament , or should it also extend to small institution ?
in my opinion , it should also apply to small institution .
this may not be practical - it be indeed the case that only a few people deal with financial control in those institution , but the principle that the person who give ex ante approval also self - assesse after the event be wrong .
these two activity should always remain separate .
this also apply to small institution even though they have few staff .
if we lay something down for large institution , the neutrality principle propose by the committee of independent expert should then apply across the board .
I be not in favour of make any exception to this rule .
otherwise , my group be able to support all the rapporteur & apos ; s amendment , especially those which stipulate that annual progress report should be compile .
public opinion be so sensitive in this area that I feel this parliament should deal with this topic every year , and not only at the discharge stage .
it should also deal with the question of how matter can be improve in term of control , and , in the light of public opinion , we can not do enough about this .
mr president , our group also support the rapporteur and thanks he for his good work .
I think the committee on budgetary control hold important discussion on this subject and the commission would certainly be well - advise always to draw on that committee & apos ; s authority during the further reform process .
I believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improve the reform .
we believe it be urgently necessary to modernise the management .
we support the commission & apos ; s step in that direction .
but we also have some criticism regard the question of final control .
we too believe there be a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control .
all this have to be bring together again in the form of overall responsibility on the part of the commission .
we also support those group that be already think about extend the reform to the small institution .
I believe the administration have to be modernise at european level in all the institution .
parliament certainly still have something to learn too and there be room for improvement in its own procedure . we hope that in general with this process we will manage to restore european public confidence in the european institution .
in future , the administration must be able to react more quickly .
we expect great gain from that .
in the past we often find that excessively lengthy decision - make process disappoint the applicant and lead to a loss of confidence in the european institution .
modernisation can do much to allay that .
but the annual audit report process be also important ; it must not be confine to the discharge but must be continuous , in the form of annual report through which we pinpoint where progress can be make , so as to restore confidence at that level too .
mr president , commissioner , mr van hulten & apos ; s report be very broadly endorse in the committee on budgetary control .
no doubt the same will happen during the vote here in plenary .
so , my compliment to mr van hulten , but may I also ask the commission to interpret this endorsement correctly .
by it we be show that we continue to support the reform it have embark on . we want these reform .
they must lead to great transparency and efficiency in the handling of the taxpayer & apo ; money and help improve the control system .
we need these reform so that we can manage substantially to speed up the payment to the legitimate recipient of aid and at long last reduce the number of budgeting error the court of auditor criticise every year .
set up an independent - and I emphasise the word independent - audit service be a step in the right direction and respond to parliament & apos ; s request in its january resolution on the reform of the commission .
however , we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control .
that be another thing this house decide in january and confirm again in the 1998 discharge .
unlike the internal audit , the traditional form of financial control check budgetary process even before agreement be sign and payment make .
these ex ante control be essential because , unlike their national colleague , the commission official have wide discretionary power in many area of financial decision - making .
independent counter - check be essential in order to avoid error .
if in future these audit be conduct decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk area , we will also manage to prevent the control from be too unwieldy .
it be essential for the financial controller to remain independent , which mean they must not come under the same director - general they be check .
in short , the controller must not be under the order of those whom they be check !
parliament have repeatedly make that clear too .
unfortunately , we be still wait in vain for a signal from the commission in this respect .
I would ask the commission to take the necessary step together with parliament !
that be in the commission & apos ; s interest too .
mr president , I should like to begin by congratulate mr van hulten on this very thorough report , which have deservedly receive the unanimous support of the other member of the committee on budgetary control .
I wish to say , commissioner , that this report be only an interim measure , which mean that it be the first step towards build a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform .
the draft version of the reform of the financial regulation be still not available in all language .
furthermore , the white paper state , quite unnecessarily , that at the end of the interim period , the council will be able to take into account whether or not the financial regulation have be approve .
the need for legal certainty require we to bring forward the deadline for this interim period , which have give rise to many reservation in this parliament , since it seem that we want to have our cake and eat it ; in other word , we want to move ahead , but without give up the precaution that be currently in place .
there be overlap , which mean that responsibility be be dilute . expenditure be double but there be no assessment of post , and so many people be do the same thing .
the staff involve be neither be give responsibility nor be motivate .
this interim period , as state in the white paper present by the committee on budgetary control , be be extend indefinitely .
I urge you , commissioner , to ensure that the interim period end as soon as possible .
we know what we want and it be the will of this parliament , but it be crucial that the transitional period should not be extend beyond what be strictly necessary .
I therefore feel that , when it come to draw up and suggest the agenda for the presidency , you should not ask we to head straight for the objective we wish to achieve , regardless of the time need to make the change in the audit .
there have also be a certain carelessness , of which I be sure the commissioner will take note , so that we will , as soon as possible , achieve the aim of this reform which we begin with the van hulten report .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the commission & apos ; s great reform project as summarise in the white paper be primarily aim at boost efficiency , i.e. , at make a real improvement in financial management , cover in fact every aspect of the budget .
in future the money be to be spend in a more targeted and effective manner , and of course we also want a well guarantee that the fund be actually spend for the purpose decide by the budgetary authority .
that be the primary aim and my colleague , mr kinnock , have repeatedly set out all the step we will take in seek to achieve it , for the reform process consist of a great many measure .
let I point out that we have already implement a large number of these individual step , be it in relation to workplace definition or to set up a central financial service in the budget directorate - general , to name only two important one .
we be now concerned with amend the financial regulation , a process which in fact only begin in 1998 when people realise how important it be to conduct not only an ex ante control , but also an internal ex post control , i.e. to have an internal audit service .
it be only since 1998 , with the seventh amendment of the old financial regulation , that the independent financial controller have be responsible for both activity .
shortly thereafter , the committee of independent expert inform we that this system be not the ideal solution either , because it contain latent conflict .
regardless of whether such conflict have in fact arise , there be a potential for conflict .
that in itself can lead to the question whether the person who give the go - ahead for expenditure ex ante really be in a position to conduct an accurate ex post control - with the necessary objectivity .
if even the slight impression could arise that the controller might no long be independent , that be reason enough for we to split this function again .
that be the proposal before we .
it have also be point out that this proposal should , of course , be incorporate in the general revision of the financial regulation , but since that revision will take quite a long time - if only because it be such a complex business - the commission have ask for this single issue to be decide in a fast - track procedure .
on the question of the financial regulation in general , let I say very briefly that I really be very sorry that the revise version be still not available in all the language .
I personally will do my utmost to speed thing up , so that parliament finally have this document in all the language .
I want to thank both committee - the committee on budgetary control and the committee on budget - for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteur , mr van hulten and mr dell & apos ; alba , who be unable to be here today .
I really do appreciate the fact that mr van hulten make such personal effort to find a good solution for this change to the financial regulation and thus to get this key component of the reform up and run .
turn now to the propose amendment , let I say briefly that the commission approve the insertion of the extra recital .
this recital - as also the amendment to article 2 ( a ) that you propose - relate to your concern , express here , that the financial controller & apos ; s function of ex ante control could be weaken during the transitional period .
that will not be the case , because we have decide - speak only in term of post now - that 80 post will be available for this ex ante control during the transitional period .
let I point out again - since misunderstanding sometimes arise here - that ex ante control be in fact base on a sample method .
in the past , 10 % of operation be control , which , however , account for 89 % of the total budget .
that be why this always have to be take into account too .
the percentage have now be cut to about 80 % , but it be base on a risk assessment .
that mean that we have 100 % control for some high - risk area .
I can understand the concern that in the absence of this ex ante control - before the money be spend - a deficit could appear .
of course the commission have take note of parliament & apos ; s concern here .
so I can only underline again that we have develop a very accurate procedure for check whether the individual directorate - general that be to be responsible for this ex ante control in future be in a position to conduct it .
only if they be able to do so will we revert to sample , to select , which be often control .
obviously that be a guarantee that must exist .
let I say briefly that the commission accept amendment no 2 , which - most importantly - provide for an annual report by the financial controller , to ensure great transparency .
in my view , the concern set out in amendment no 3 be also most important , namely that a differentiated approach should be take to the different institution .
that mean the commission , the council and parliament must under all circumstance separate ex ante control from the independent audit service , while the small institution , which do indeed have a far , far small operational budget , should be free to choose whether to separate they .
that is , of course , also a question of experience .
perhaps it will be conclude at some point that this should be make compulsory ; but for the time be it should be leave to their discretion .
I think that will also make it easy to implement this reform .
I really find this proposal so useful that I be only sorry I do not think of it myself .
but that also show how important it be for the commission and parliament to interact constructively .
let I therefore thank you for your proposal and your opinion .
thank you very much , commissioner schreyer .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
parental control of television broadcasting
mr president , commissioner reding , lady and gentleman , this report on the possibility of establish parental control of television broadcasting in order to protect minor tackle an issue which be extremely important and topical , all the more so when we consider the grow number of television programme on offer and the increasingly wide and increasingly uncontrolled distribution of the internet .
to this I would add two further observation : on the one hand , the number of minor with direct access to television and computer be constantly increase and , on the other , there be a worrying increase in the broadcasting of violent image - portray all possible type of violence - both in television programme and over the internet .
for example , last week in italy , a racket traffic paedophile pornography via the internet be uncover . this discovery be then broadcast on the television network .
however , some of the image take from the site investigate be also show , cause great consternation amongst the citizen over the unscrupulous use of such picture , which be or be certainly inappropriate and harmful for the minor who be watch television at the time .
to return to the report , as you be aware , the european commission be prepare a report on the implementation of the & apo ; television without frontier & apo ; directive , to be publish in the next few month . guideline and consideration on the protection of minor must be include in this report in an appropriate manner .
I would also like to point out that article 22 , paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specify that all the member state must take appropriate measure to ensure that broadcast by television broadcaster do not include any programme which might impair the physical , mental or moral development of minor , in particular programme that contain pornography or gratuitous violence .
therefore , we be all aware that , in practice , this be certainly not a simple undertaking .
however , in the light of these consideration , our task be to define the objective which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine , reliable protection for minor .
firstly , we must identify all the technological system in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or internet of material which could be consider harmful to the psychological development of minor : I refer , in particular , to filtering system and programme classification system .
however , we must also take into account the introduction of the digital system , which will facilitate the use and broadcasting of such programme .
secondly , we must specify that , in addition to the technological control system which I have mention , a further two element be essential to prepare the ground , so to speak .
firstly , we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness - raise policy target family and the world of education in general .
secondly , we must encourage producer to take responsibility for the quality of television programme and broadcaster to take responsibility for broadcasting procedure for these programme .
however , having say this , if we be to produce more than empty word to protect child we do need to provide clear recommendation on the protection of minor in the media context .
I would like to end by say that , in accordance with the vote which take place in committee , I can not accept amendment nos 1 and 4 table by the liberal group or amendment nos 5 and 6 table by the group of the party of european socialist , whereas I welcome amendment nos 2 and 3 table by the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party .
mr president , lady and gentleman , today we be debate a report that give rise to much controversy when it be discuss in our committee , all spark off by the term subsidiarity .
but at a time when we not only have a surplus of audiovisual offering but also excess consumption of these offering , we can not retreat behind the word subsidiarity .
as politician , we simply have a responsibility , in all the area in which we act , to protect young people from that surplus .
at a time when we be witness so much violence , hatred and intolerance in all our country , we surely have to ask ourselves where it be come from .
now , I can not say : it all come from television .
but no doubt much of it can be trace back to the excessive consumption of these television offering , some of which incite to hatred and intolerance , include intolerance towards other nationality .
so we must give serious thought to how we can check this .
we have a responsibility towards minor !
subsidiarity be to be welcome . and we want to preserve it ; but I beg you , let we not hide behind it .
it be our job to do something , and indeed we have already try to introduce this kind of protection of minor with our first & quot ; television without frontier & quot ; directive .
I be think now of mr hoppenstedt , who fight for the v chip .
but what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier ?
not much ; child usually know how to handle it well than adult , which mean we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation .
we do not intend to replace anyone who be do a good job at national level , but we do want to introduce common criterion and minimum requirement at community level and propose rule that help people effectively to implement measure to protect minor in their country .
of course I also think that we be not in a position , either as politician or as technician , to tackle this problem on our own .
far more important than all this , of course , be the role of the teacher and the parent , and handle this medium correctly .
television and the internet have to be learn and , of course , also teach .
so what we be do today be just a small part of the job that society as a whole have to perform .
I believe we must bring up our child to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parent to encourage their child to watch suitable programme and disregard the less suitable one .
that be why we should do both , do our job as politician and urge society to do its bit .
unfortunately , I can not endorse the liberal & apo ; demand .
I find they too liberal and not really gear to the interest of the minority we be consider here .
mr president , lady and gentleman , mrs pack , how much television violence can a child tolerate ?
the question be not nearly as easy to answer as some people think .
and that be one of the finding that have come out of the highly commendable & quot ; study on parental control of television broadcasting & quot ; that be the subject of the commission communication .
despite an impressive number of international study , there be still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and media consumption .
someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image see on the medium , but that do not mean that the cause of that act be also to be find in the media image .
that be a most important finding , for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well - being of child and young people and , in particular , we must not mistake the real cause of the sad reality of youth violence .
youth violence be the result of a build - up of several factor , such as experience violence in the family , suffer serious social disadvantage , have poor chance for the future because of lack of education , which lead to frustration , which in turn find its outlet in violence .
that fit in with the experience I myself have glean during ten year of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile court .
technical measure to control television offering can not resolve these problem .
fortunately , however , the vast majority of child and young people grow up in an environment free of all these type of problem .
that be the good youth protection there can possibly be .
here we see parent who be committed to pass on their own moral value and life experience to their child .
as a rule these be root in a particular cultural , social and societal background .
system of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis .
that be also what the commission be seek to do , with reference to the finding of the study .
basically , the report we be to vote on here also support that approach .
at the same time , of course , no - one dispute that medium image can influence moral value .
but we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter system , that in no way take away from broadcaster responsibility .
the committee on culture , youth , education , the medium and sport have therefore call in so many word for the programme and provider responsibility to be establish .
that be and remain mainly the task of member state legislation , although it certainly do not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic value in a dialogue with all concerned at european level .
finally , the committee on culture , youth , education , the medium and sport also consider it important to urge the commission to extend all youth protection measure to multimedia offering of all kind , since image of violence and other harmful content be certainly no long confine to conventional television .
europe & apos ; s child have be surf the internet for a long time now , and they be do so more and more .
it be more important for the child and their parent to learn to use the medium properly than to introduce legal restriction and electronic filter .
that be an educational and social task .
mr president , mrs pack be right .
we be concern here with the proximity principle .
the eu be face a number of challenge - enlargement towards the east , the intergovernmental conference and the treaty in nice .
these question be at the top of the agenda .
the problem relate to democracy and to the eu & apos ; s closeness to the people be other crucial issue .
it be a question of the eu & apos ; s political legitimacy in the eye of the people - and time be rather press .
I believe that solve these problem be a prerequisite for the success of the european project as a whole .
in his splendid major speech yesterday , president of the commission romano prodi mention that , for the sake of the eu & apos ; s political legitimacy in the future , it will be necessary to produce a list of those subject the eu be to deal with and those which the member state be to deal with .
I entirely agree with the president of the commission about the need to prepare such a list along the line of a constitution , and I be quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforce and that the eu must therefore refrain from make policy on the wide range of area in which the political problem be not of a cross - border nature .
the eu should stick to the key political issue .
in so far as the president of the commission have have any idea about which area belong where , I hope that he share my view that issue of parental control of child & apos ; s television viewing do not belong on the eu & apos ; s agenda .
on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , I have therefore table a number of amendment , the purpose of which be to limit the effect of this report in so far as it may be adopt .
allow I finally to emphasise that the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party be also concerned about the increase in the number of tv programme contain sex and violence .
we be also convinced that these programme be in no way of benefit to viewer and certainly not to child .
but , all other thing be equal , I think it be the job of parent to prevent their child from see that sort of thing at home .
mr president , our sitting be not be broadcast on television !
it would be good for the world to be able to see your impose figure preside over the house , and a live television programme broadcast at this time of day show our alluring commissioner would be just the thing .
but there be no television camera here . we be not be film .
it be not enough to leave parent to keep watch over their child : we ban the toy !
that be what we do .
and why , in this case , then , do we not just ban all programme which be harmful to we all ?
oh , no . in this case , we leave parent to keep an eye on their child .
but consider how often be parent at home , how often they have to go out .
we should also ban mobile phone , the wap phone we hear so much about , which all the youngster will soon be carry about town , put their life at risk from traffic because they be watch television programme and absorb in material from all the different state of the european union display on their mobile phone .
I do not , therefore , agree with the word of the liberal member who have just speak .
I be afraid that the heavens and the satellite will soon be rain signal from all over the union down on all our state .
and it be therefore important for a european directive to be adopt to prevent the transmission of harmful material .
mr president , commissioner , our child access and use televise , print and new medium on a daily basis and as a matter of course .
information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge be deliver to the home in record time and our child can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis .
at the same time , a huge selection of different entertainment programme be available to they , usually without any control .
aside from all the positive aspect , we must not disregard the negative side - effect of this ease of access .
child be be face day by day with a grow wave of medium brutality and violence , which be simply too much for they , especially because no limit be impose on these offering .
so all those concern , start with the child , via the parent , the teacher , the country , the european union and , beyond they , the supplier and producer must come to grip with this question and learn how to deal with these offering and their effect .
the public must be make more aware of the effect of this constantly grow wave of violence and support measure must be take .
these measure must not be restrict to television but must apply to all accessible medium .
the candidate country must of course also be integrate in this process even at this stage .
since the medium market be a matter of supply and demand , i.e. , a question of hard business , the provider pay no attention to the consequence of various offering .
all that count be the rating .
so we must introduce protective mechanism that be impossible , or at least not easy , to circumvent .
furthermore , I believe programme that help reduce and overcome violence and aggression should also be on offer .
no doubt they could not be market so spectacularly and would therefore produce low rating , but in return they could make a considerable contribution to damage limitation and to combat the adverse effect .
we be responsible for ensure that our young people can shape a future society in which violence and aggression be not present as hip or cool or as example to be copy but as deeply reprehensible .
we have to match up to that responsibility by adopt the appropriate directive and provide the necessary support .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , one sunday evening a fortnight ago in the south of france , johan , aged 17 , and robert , aged 16 , murder their childhood friend , romain , with a firearm and a baseball bat , for no reason or motive , just like on tv .
arrest very soon afterwards , they tell the police , & quot ; it & apos ; s funny , they don & apos ; t get catch that easily on the telly . & quot ;
they also say that they want to see what it be like to kill someone in real life .
this occur not far away and not very long ago .
it happen on 17 september , close to home , in europe .
there be no question of simplify matter or engage in generalisation , even if we do have a limited time for speak in the european parliament , but there be a great many example .
it may be remember that , a few year ago , oliver stone & apos ; s film , & apos ; natural bear killer & apos ; , generate the same controversy by give rise to copycat crime by youngster in the united states and france .
so when I hear some people state in debate in committee that there be nothing to prove that television violence in all its form may have a harmful influence upon child , I be , to put it mildly , surprised .
we be often alarmed at the television programme our child watch .
the on - screen violence of all kind to which child be subject , whether it be on television or through the computer , have short- , medium- and long - term consequence .
the purpose of this report be to help we , as parent and grandparent , to protect minor and to provide we with a tool enable we to make well , informed choice for our child .
just how be that an attack on the principle of subsidiarity ?
the audiovisual medium continue to be the exclusive domain of the member state .
at no point do the report suggest potential harmonisation .
at the very most , the talk be of tentative convergence .
with regard to the protection of minor in the media context , the definition of common criterion be therefore , of necessity , minimal , give the cultural , moral and social variation in our member state .
establish minimum criterion be the very least the european union can do for its child .
I would also support the rapporteur when she explain the need to make sure that all family be guarantee the right to an affordable filtering system .
that be say , these device must not , and can not , exonerate broadcaster and educator from fulfil their responsibility .
child will very quickly learn to manipulate these filter system well than ourselves .
legislator - and I have almost finish speak now - can not regulate everything , but they must occasionally remind everyone what their right and duty be .
I believe that that be what we be do today .
mr president , I should like to thank both the european parliament and its rapporteur for the important work which have be do on this issue .
I remember that , when the v - chip be discuss in this house , I be among the mep who bang their fist on the table and demand that parent have the opportunity to exercise supervision .
the commission share the view express in the report that cooperation between member state and the commission be essential if minor be to be well protect over the next few year .
this do not mean harmonisation .
no one want this , no one have talk about it and no one intend to implement it .
the idea be to draw up minimum rule .
I be the last person to attack subsidiarity .
I defend it , because it be essential .
subsidiarity must serve some purpose , however , and not act as a screen .
I be convinced that , when it come to protect young people , we be in prime position of responsibility , and I be also convinced that there be ethical consideration more important than the strictly legalistic one .
with regard to the introduction of a self - regulation code , it should be note , particularly in term of the technical aspect , that , in a number of member state , broadcaster have already introduce code system for television set to enable parent to cut off the power .
the commission be also consult the digital videobroadcasting group , or dvb , about the technical aspect of system for protect minor , particularly digital filter .
like parliament , the commission also think that each family ought to have access to these filtering device at affordable price .
as you know , however , no effective system be yet to be find where television be concerned .
however , filter be available to the public for use with the internet , and this should speed up the development of similar filter for television , especially digital one .
in short , when more programme be put on the market , parent will have the technical mean of prevent their child from watch certain broadcast .
let we not , however , forget the ethical and legal aspect .
the problem be certainly not to be solve at the touch of a button or just by pull a plug .
as have be say in this house , journalist , programme maker and broadcaster be also responsible .
I should like to remind you that the commission have adopt an action plan design to promote safe internet use and also to make user more aware of the problem .
I think too that , even if this public awareness campaign relate to the internet , it will also have a knock - on effect on television programme .
it be true , as parliament acknowledge , that the member state do not share the same idea about what minor should or should not be permit to see .
the report consider there to be good reason for aim at progressive convergence , even if it be premature at this stage to define the criterion involve in such convergence .
although I do not think it be feasible to adopt uniform criterion , I think it be our responsibility to arrive at some classification of the content of television programme , while leave parent the option of decide whether the programme may or may not be watch by minor .
I should also like to say something in response to the content of a national television channel which show offensive picture on the pretext of provide information .
let I tell you that , in journalism , there have always be an ethical code and a system of self - regulation for apply this code , and this have operate quite well , I have to say .
there be always exception , when thing go wrong , but exception be precisely what they be and all the more shocking for be so .
in my opinion , the profession have to be make more responsible so that it take responsibility itself for the content of broadcast and for what will and will not be show .
I myself be a professional journalist for twenty year .
I will tell you something : journalist can not write and show everything they know about or be aware of , or divulge all the information they have , because it may do a lot of harm to third party .
in its report , parliament also invite the commission to encourage the creation of a think tank with the job of draw up a memorandum contain the basic legal principle apply in the member state for the purpose of protect minor in the media context .
the commission will respond to this invitation because , as you know , we be due to table the & apos ; television without frontier & apo ; directive again in 2002 , with a view to test the water .
I think it will be very important , in that context , to launch a broad debate on our society & apo ; s responsibility where the medium be concern .
when I say society & apos ; s responsibility , I be think not only of european government but also of political responsibility at national level , the responsibility of medium practitioner and the responsibility of parent and of society in general .
I be also very aware of the remark make about education , about training in the interpretation of image and about make young people more aware of the need to approach the medium in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing , at any time and in any way .
I would also say that the industry have already devise an international system of self - regulation call the internet content rating association , in which the commission participate .
consideration could be give to encourage the creation of a similar initiative cover audiovisual content .
your thought on this matter would be welcome , as they would be in the context of & apos ; television without frontier & apo ; .
where , finally , the protection of minor be concern , I should like to point out that there be a council recommendation of 24 september on promote national framework design to ensure comparable and effective level of protection of minor and of human dignity .
there be plan for the commission to prepare a report for parliament and the council on the measure take by the member state to apply this recommendation .
the objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach propose , an approach base on the principle of self - regulation , and my official have just set the work in motion and have send a questionnaire out to the member state .
one thing be certain , I think .
the problem will not be solve through technical , technological or other such measure . it be society as a whole which have to assume responsibility .
we be in the process of assume our own share of responsibility .
let other assume theirs and , believe I , I shall call for everyone to play their part in apply a solution .
thank you very much , commissioner reding .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
education and training : mobility within the community
mr president , this report cover a very important issue and one that have be prominent in my post bag for nearly six year .
if we be serious about the european ideal , we have to be able to ensure that it be easily sell to those who be convinced about the concept and those who be not .
I be a teacher for 16 year and now , as an mep , I have spend a lot of time in school , college , and at conference argue for just this sort of action .
it link in with many positive initiative over the last few year with which we be all familiar - socrate , youth for europe , leonardo and so on . young people in general be very positive about the european union .
they do not have the problem often associate with other age group .
they be use to multicultural and diverse community .
but confront , as they so often be , by factor that work against the european ideal , they rely on their own experience .
we have to ensure that the experience of young people - student and other in the educational world - be positive .
nothing will be more damaging to their develop view , than if a report such as this fail to make progress or if it fail to deliver great mobility or if it fail to at least start to demolish the barrier that confront educational mobility today .
back to the beginning .
when it first present its report , the commission accept that its recommendation be less than satisfactory .
I understand that it even consider withdraw it .
since then , a great deal of work by my own staff , by parliament & apos;s staff and indeed by the commission & apos;s own staff , to all of whom I pay warm tribute , have present we with what I think , until today , be perhaps a worthy if not perfect report , certainly one that be satisfactory and would go some way to achieve my aim .
today , and at the eleventh hour , the commission have advise I , albeit indirectly , of its difficulty .
firstly , I understand that the commission now believe that all reference to researcher to be outside the legal base as provide for under article 149 and 150 .
I ask the question : why be this information only available on the 4 october ?
why have someone wait until now to come up with this ?
be this legal advice not know when on numerous occasion I discuss its inclusion with member of the commission staff ?
indeed , when mr mantovani and I and the whole social affairs committee be encourage to progress the case , why be I tell that the researcher would be the subject of a later commission recommendation if there be no legal base for it ?
and why in 1996 do the commission publish a green paper - education , training and research - if there be no legal base for it ?
be that , I ask , not a waste of commission and parliament time and indeed money , then and now .
no - one have more respect than I for mrs reding and her commission staff so I be sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular point that I raise and that she will not present a prepared statement .
I will now turn to some of the particular which I address in the report - detail which be define and hone in response to discussion with a huge number of party , from student to minister , teach union to government , representative from several , if not all , the country .
the report seek to remove legal and administrative , and indeed cultural , barrier to mobility .
it promote the wide use of a variety of financial mean of assistance .
it try to promote an eu - wide area of qualification and specifically to make the lot of third - country national easier regard mobility .
specifically my report replace the worthy international generalisation by , in effect , repatriate the decision to the member state .
I try to make sure that the report only cover area over which parliament and the commission have jurisdiction .
I have endeavour to ensure the recommendation with any fiscal implication be limit to a bare minimum .
as with any parliament report , experience have show that there be little chance of anything happen , or at good little possibility of uniformity across europe , if there be no monitoring .
for reason which I understand , but which will have the effect of neuter the whole report , the commission will , I be lead to believe , be reject amendment nos 46 to 51 .
indeed , they have already press - release it to the effect that they be go to do so .
in conclusion , I be both pleased and flattered when this report be refer to by president chirac in his speech to parliament some week ago .
if the french presidency be now serious , then I suggest that council will have to work very hard to salvage both their and the commission & apos;s reputation as a matter of urgency for I suggest the failure to endorse this report in its entirety will send all the wrong , and very confusing , message to important group of our society .
, draftsman of the opinion of the committee on employment and social affair .
( it ) mr president , as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on employment and social affair on this proposal for a recommendation , I would like to express my satisfaction at the end document , which be the result of a joint effort by mr evans , mrs marten and myself . I would especially like to thank mr evans and mr marten for their fruitful cooperation .
during the ninety the commission produce several recommendation on the issue but no practical solution be find .
the problem to be resolve vary from country to country : for example , regulation differ on matter of social security , study grant , right of residence and taxation , and there be no system for the mutual recognition of qualification and work placement .
then there be a dearth of information on opportunity for mobility and there be the barrier of the lack of knowledge of language .
I would draw attention , out of the amendment table , to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researcher , since this category be originally include in the green paper .
this be why the category of researcher should be include , mr evans .
I therefore call upon the member state to make every endeavour , alongside the commission , to resolve the bureaucratic and other problem of mobility , and to set specific goal in the form of a two - yearly action plan and a final report .
this be the very minimum necessary if we be to achieve that area of freedom which be the basic right of every european citizen .
mr president , in my capacity as draftsperson of the committee on petition , I should like to congratulate mr evans on his excellent report on the mobility of student , researcher and person undergo training and to thank he for having take the concern of our committee into account .
of all the petition we receive , many relate either to mobility within the european union , and in particular that of student , researcher and person undergo training , or to the recognition of qualification .
the difficulty encounter by the petitioner be due , on the one hand , to the lack , or the complexity , of legal text and , on the other hand , to government & apo ; failure to respond to the seriousness of these problem .
the commission need to draw up a list of the problem encounter by european citizen , particularly with regard to the issue of freedom of residence and freedom of establishment and , most especially , with regard to their right to work , study and obtain recognition of their qualification in other member state .
this list must be accompany by practical measure such as the establishment of objective to be achieve by the member state and the obligation on the latter to prepare periodic report on the progress achieve .
student mobility would be improve if the period of study complete in each member state , together with the qualification and certificate acquire , be to be fully recognise within the european union .
the european commission should take ambitious initiative design , in the short term , to provide for the reciprocal recognition of academic qualification between member state .
by respond to the problem of daily life , this european parliament and council recommendation should make it possible to bring europe close to its citizen , in particular its young citizen who should be the force involve in create a european identity .
mr president , the 1996 green paper on mobility list the obstacle to mobility .
four year down the line , we have to recognise that very little have be do .
there be still major obstacle , for example in the field of social security , health cover , extend residence permit , taxation , etc .
I lament the fact that , as a consequence , young people be prevent from gain experience - study , work or other experience - in another member state .
it be about time that europe turn its attention once more to the sound implementation of programme such as socrate and youth for europe .
it be thank to these programme that young people can come into contact with the thinking , the language and the culture of other country .
this be why these programme which promote student mobility be so crucially important .
after all , the experience which these people gather contribute to a broad understanding of european culture , they enhance professional experience and the command of language , encourage familiarity with the european patrimony and increase the chance of find employment .
this be why threshold need to be lower on behalf of student , volunteer , university teacher and researcher - yes , I include researcher in this as well .
in line with the 1996 green paper on mobility , this group should also benefit from the recommendation in this report .
I believe that the european commission be wrong to exclude they .
some outstanding payment date back as far as 1996 .
the french presidency have prioritise improved mobility for this target group .
mr evans have do sterling work and thank to sound cooperation , the culture committee approve the report on mobility unanimously last month .
this be a sign that the continuous obstacle to mobility which stand in the way of student , volunteer , university teacher and researcher should be swiftly remove .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , promote the mobility of student , trainer and teacher be be see as an ever more important part of the european strategy .
it be give attention , for example , in lisbon last march at the summit there , in which matter of employment , social participation and the information society be focus on .
in the lisbon conclusion , mobility be recognise as an essential element in the information society and in the promotion of lifelong training .
robert j. evans & apos ; s report therefore discuss an extremely important issue .
the great credit go to the rapporteur for an approach base on the point of view of the public and the practical problem involve .
mobility be not to be promote by noble objective but by remove the day - to - day obstacle .
I hope that the main amendment adopt by the committee on culture , youth , education , the medium and sport will be receive positively by the council , as they deserve to be , and that legislation be speedily bring into effect .
when it come to student and teacher mobility , experience show that the real problem of mobility be not find so much in the area of educational administration , but with the social , tax and immigration authority .
problem with regard to retain social security benefit , transfer benefit , and taxation still hamper mobility within the union .
question of responsibility have also be raise , especially when it be a matter of on - the - job learning .
regard our own problem in the education sector , we can not steer away from the difficulty there be in approve study credit .
student be still pretty much dependent on the good will of the lecturer .
if that be miss , study abroad might unduly extend the actual length of time a person study .
I be very glad that the rapporteur pay attention in his report to the opportunity for national of country apply for membership to be include in the recommendation on mobility .
the most serious problem at present concern those come from non - member country .
improve their status will be an effective way of build a common europe .
what be also important in this report be the attention give to the equal treatment of those who be the most disadvantaged , for example , the disabled .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , I would like to start by thank mr evans and mr mantovani for their work .
our group - the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party - have table amendment which include the category of researcher in the recommendation : we be therefore in favour of include researcher .
moreover , we would stress that , although the proposal be certainly a firm step in the right direction , in our opinion , there be certain gap which will require we , or rather the commission , to work on eliminate all the remain barrier of an administrative , legal , linguistic and cultural , but also financial nature .
at the same time , it need to produce active measure firmly promote the teaching of at least two community language in every country and develop and support the cultural and linguistic education of our young - and not - so - young - citizen . this should include the use of new method and new technology .
we also agree that there be a need to give all those who participate in this mobility system clear , comprehensive information regard their social security right . in addition , we agree that direct and indirect taxis such as the tax payable for renewal of residence permit should be abolish immediately .
certainly , as liberal democrats , we agree that this mobility system should be extend to include the candidate country as soon as possible , and we would like to express our regret at the continue delay in the mutual recognition of qualification , an issue with which commissioner reding be quite familiar and which we know to be very important to she .
commissioner , we call upon you to act incisively within the commission on this unresolved matter , so that , in full respect for national power and sovereignty , we will indeed be able to talk of a europe of people , a europe of citizen , but also a europe of culture .
for if europe be not a europe of culture , it will never be europe !
mr president , I would like to join my colleague in thank the rapporteur for the tremendous work which he have do on this report and also to congratulate the member of the committee on employment and social affair and the committee on petition who have draft opinion .
this be a very sensitive subject because , as my colleague have already point out to the commission and council , a lot of hindrance be put in the way of student , lecturer , people undergo training and volunteer with regard to mobility within the community .
freedom of movement for person , good , service and capital be enshrine in our treaty and yet young people , who be the future of the european union and perhaps have few prejudice than some of we adult be deny opportunity because of the bureaucratic barrier put in their way .
the socrate programme be mention as one example of this .
a survey carry out by the commission in 1998 on the erasmus programme , cover 10,000 student , show that less than 50 % of the available place be actually take up on a full - time basis and that over 60 % of the student who take those course encounter financial difficulty .
what this highlight be that unless some serious remedial action be take on the financing of the erasmus programme and the kind of support that be make available to student , there will be inequality between those whose parent can afford to send they and those whose parent can not .
I speak on this issue in this house in the last session , but I would once again urge eu education minister to grasp the nettle and make sure that proper initiative and proper funding be put in place . I would also call on the commissioner to ensure that in the next round of proper funding be available for the erasmus programme .
one point I would like to raise finally while we be on the subject of mobility be the ongoing case in one of the member state of the european union with which I have be involve for the last five year , namely the question of foreign lecturer in italy .
despite several opinion from the court , recommendation from commissioner and action at council level , nothing have be do to regulate the position of these foreign lecturer whose status be reduce by the italian education minister .
action need to be take to ensure that those inequality do not continue .
I would commend this report to the house and recommend support for the amendment put forward by mr evans .
mr president , commissioner , I wish , informally but nonetheless from the heart , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr evans and mrs marten , as well as the draftsperson of the opinion , because to my mind , these issue have not be address so directly , sincerely and authentically for a very long time .
I believe this to be political honesty , even if it be not pleasant to hear .
we have speak many time about mobility and the shortcoming that exist in its regard .
I would say that in europe we be currently live in a climate of considerable moral fraud .
fraud , not necessarily in the eye of the law , but certainly moral fraud , because we be send student to other country and then we give no recognition to their study and nor do we give they certificate .
this be moral fraud , in which we be willing partner .
what can we do ?
I think that we can do a great deal .
as the commission and parliament , we can demand compliance from programme that be fund by the commission .
we can not allow university not to recognise qualification .
europe & apos ; s university , in france , spain and elsewhere , be autonomous and have the power to decide whether they will recognise diploma and the subject that have be study .
university that do not comply , however , must forfeit their subsidy .
there must be clear check and monitoring , even if only of a sample , and above all , a web site , where student can register their complaint .
this be not expensive at all .
we be not only protect the right of young people , since the same apply to researcher .
it be pointless to talk about lifelong learning if we ignore researcher .
mrs reding , mr busquin and his directorate - general be not do anything about the training of researcher , nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualification or about doctor & apo ; training .
this have today create a void in the european union and unless the committee on culture , youth , education , the medium and sport address the problem , europe will probably not be in a position to compete in the medium , in the cinema or in research in information technology .
our human resource be our only future in a world in which there be no more valuable commodity than knowledge .
we can not allow this field to be take away from we , even if this make thing uncomfortable in term of the european parliament work closely with the commission .
I think we should ask mr prodi to do everything possible to ensure that young people study abroad do not feel like orphan and that researcher be not leave without support , at the mercy of what their rector decide .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , it be our declare aim to make europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge society in the world , an economic area that be able to achieve sustained economic growth with more and well job and great social cohesion .
so we must make every effort to close the exist gap between word on paper and the actual , practical difficulty the european citizen still encounter every day .
here , the european dimension in the field of education and training play an important role .
we must , therefore , ensure that the freedom lay down in the treaty such as the right of residence and free movement , do not remain empty word .
transnational mobility be not just an occupational and economic requirement but call for a forward - look basic approach .
precisely for that reason I be still very surprised to see how many obstacle remain to great mobility and flexibility in europe .
we therefore call for research worker to be include in the scope of the recommendation .
finally , we call for measure to create great transparency in the recognition of qualification , period of study and training .
we call on the commission to play a more active role in promote the mutual recognition of training certificate , which advance mobility and flexibility , so that we really can achieve our declare aim .
mr president , lady and gentleman , may I first of all thank the rapporteur and also all those , in the relevant committee and in this chamber , who have commit themselves to make mobility a reality .
believe I , I know what you be say , and a lot more besides .
it be through practical action and not through green or white paper or , for that matter , black or red one , that problem be solve .
and what we have here be practical action .
believe I , it be not easy .
do not imagine that , by set a recommendation down on paper , there will be cheer of joy from all the member state .
no , a number of member state will have to be force to eliminate obstacle of a kind which may seem ridiculous .
however , there be still definitely barrier to the removal of these obstacle , and I have not finish persuade all the member state of the fact , but I be still optimistic .
I be an optimist for two reason .
first of all because , as a european commissioner , if I want to make progress , I can not allow myself to be pessimistic ; and secondly because , in spite of all the problem of which I be aware , hundred of thousand of student and hundred and thousand of parent and grandparent thank I when I meet they and tell I that the experience they be able to have be terrific .
go into the street and ask young , and not so young , people which european programme they have hear of , and they will tell you - socrate and erasmus .
so , in spite of the persistent problem , of which I be aware , these programme be of positive value and contribute something to the people of europe .
I agree with you that the obstacle which still exist need to be remove .
I would thank you for your cooperation on this matter .
it be easy to talk in a speech about remove obstacle , but less easy to remove they in practice .
what be more , most of the problem of which we be aware do not stem from the commission but from the member state and even the region .
what , then , be the state of play regard the financial problem ?
mrs pack , you be witness to the fact that the commission and parliament have agree between themselves to request more money because they know very well that the erasmus grant be not enough and that only those who receive help from their parent or grandparent or who work during their erasmus study have the opportunity of benefit from these erasmus grant .
all right , what be give be give .
you have to make do .
that be why I have ask the minister , since they have not give I any more money , to ensure that supplement to the erasmus grant be offer in their country , and this be something we be discuss .
last saturday , I be in paris for a council of minister for education , exclusively on the issue of mobility .
thing be move , and not just in the abstract .
the rapporteur quote president chirac & apos ; s word on mobility .
the french presidency wish to make mobility one of the key issue of its term of office , and will go on to do just that .
in november , the minister of education be go to take a decision not only on this recommendation , which be a small step in the right direction , but also on an action plan to be implement in order to facilitate mobility and turn this into a reality .
at the council meeting in nice , mobility will be one of the item for discussion .
so you see , thing be move .
not everything need to be see in negative term , because there be a lot of progress .
I would say to you , however , that , for thing to continue to move , some pressure need to be exert .
so , help I to apply some pressure .
you be do so today and will do so tomorrow .
I should like to thank you right now for do this .
I should also like to say that the french presidency be not the only one to have make progress in this area .
the portuguese presidency do a marvellous and very useful job of prepare the ground , and I should like to pay tribute to both presidency for the way they wish to make progress .
the lisbon summit be something of a point of departure for a long journey which we be only just begin .
our head of state and of government and the regional and national government have realise that education have a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social side of the european union .
the creation of a europe of knowledge be therefore a very important step in the right direction , but we still have a very long way to go .
I have no hesitation in tell you that we shall do more than just talk . we shall take practical step , but it can not happen overnight .
we have to keep chip persistently away at the issue and never give up apply the pressure . however , we shall get there .
with regard to the amendment , the following may be accept : 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 16 to 18 , 25 to 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 33 to 38 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 52 , 53 , 54 and 55 .
I be also able to accept the follow amendment , as reword : 7 , 9 , 13 , 20 , 23 , 29 , 32 , 42 , 52 and 57 on the basis of the english text .
and , finally , I be able to retain the follow amendment in part : 6 , 10 , 15 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 and 42 .
that be almost all of they .
let we now turn to the amendment which present problem . these concern researcher .
ever since the beginning , it have be more or less clear that researcher could not be part of the recommendation .
however , as be its proper role , parliament have exert pressure for researcher to be include in the text nonetheless .
the commission have respond to parliament , and these problem be tackle in a communication adopt on 18 january on the european research area and , in the follow - up to this communication , commissioner busquin will be present a communication on the mobility of researcher .
there will therefore be a specific communication on this subject , and I think it be partly thank to the pressure exert by parliament that this be go to happen .
allow I now to return to amendment nos 46 to 51 which , with a view to ensure that the recommendation be follow up , request the member state and the commission to put in place a process which might be consider similar to the luxembourg process in the case of employment .
I agree with the objective , but there be an important reason why the commission have adopt the position it have on these amendment , and that be because , by accept they as they stand and in their present propose wording , the same problem would arise as when we speak about the action plan which the minister and the commission want to have finish draft by november .
considerable new human resource , which do not exist at present , would be necessary .
I do not want to leave the matter as it stand .
that be why I speak about it this morning at the meeting of the commission , and the conclusion draw by the commissioner be clear .
follow the communication of the 26 july on match human resource to the institution & apos ; s task , the commission can not accept new task unless the budgetary authority allocate it the necessary resource for carry these out .
this be a position of principle , to be apply generally and not only to what be of concern to we now .
it be a collegiate position adopt by the commission , in view of the decision take , in view of the peer group and in view of staff problem .
from now on , the commission will give the same answer on all topic .
the budgetary authority will therefore have to ensure that we have the material resource for take action .
that be say , I should nonetheless like to remind you that the commission already have a monitoring system which will be place within the framework of the new open method of coordination , recommend by the lisbon european council .
this open method of cooperation be base upon the assumption that european guideline will be establish , the implementation of which it will be possible to adapt in relation to regional and national diversity .
it will also , however , enable monitoring to be carry out periodically so that the member state can progressively develop their own strategy where mobility be concern .
I think , mr mantovani , that , over and above the question of principle that bind I to the commission & apos ; s collegiate decision , there be an avenue to be explore here , and it might perhaps be necessary to look for alternative in this area .
in any case , I be happy to have a discussion with you to see what can be do in this respect .
a good start have be make .
finally , amendment no 58 can not be adopt , quite simply because it duplicate amendment no 37 propose by parliament on the same subject .
we all want the same thing .
we want there to be real progress on this issue in the real condition in our region and our member state .
I should also like to do much more when it come to the recognition of qualification .
at the moment , and as the treaty at present stand , it be a national responsibility , which be not to say that I be not do anything .
I be in constant discussion with minister . I also know that account have to be take of the autonomy and independence of university but , by mean of our network system , we have bring the university close together , and they engage ever more frequently in joint venture and recognise student from other university and study complete in those university .
thing be move slowly , and that be frustrating because the objective can be see there before we .
it be a fine objective , and we should like matter to move more quickly .
in politic , thing do not , unfortunately , always move as quickly as one would wish .
if , however , the pressure be keep up , we shall get there .
so , help I to do just that .
thank you very much , commissioner reding .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( the sitting be close at 11.12 p.m. )
address by mr ciampi , president of the italian republic
mr president , it be my great honour to welcome you to the european parliament .

this optimism have be heighten in recent day by the numerous intervention that we have hear from the member state .
but now be also the beginning of a key stage for the intergovernmental conference .

the event in yugoslavia , which give cause for hope but which be also at a highly critical stage , be also be follow by this house as closely as you would expect .
we be aware , it be true , that much be expect of europe and of the european parliament .
we be particularly conscious of this , mr president , last september , when we welcome the speaker of the knesset and the speaker of the palestinian legislative council , who come here together , to this very rostrum , to deliver a message brim with peace and hope .
finally , you have demonstrate your confidence - and I would thank you for this - in the role play by the european parliament and in the cooperation between our institution , and more especially between the european parliament and the commission .
the way in which this house receive the very powerful speech make by mr prodi yesterday show not only that this cooperation be harmonious , but also that we have share ambition for the future of europe .
you can rely on our institution to bring their full weight to bear to reach solution which be commensurate to the challenge we face .
( loud applause ) ( the formal sitting be close at 12.35 p.m. )
equal opportunity
the next item be the joint debate on :
the council statement on : equal opportunity ; equal participation by man and woman ;
the report ( a5 - 0198 / 2000 ) by mrs dybkjær , on behalf of the committee on woman & apos;s right and equal opportunity , on the commission annual report & apo ; equal opportunity for woman and man in the european union - 1997 , 1998 , 1999 & apos ; .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , this be the third time I have have the pleasure of address the house since the french presidency begin . I first address the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity on 11 july and , on 5 september , I make a statement about the monitoring centre for industrial change .
today , I be here to talk about balanced participation by man and woman in all area of society .
the motion for a resolution on the commission & apos ; s report that you will be vote on later go into great detail on the subject .
I would like to comment on three point highlight by mrs dybkjær , and I commend the quality of her work as rapporteur to this house .
first , as regard the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regard work , employment , education , training , family life , health , and the dignity of woman , we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlie discrimination .
the second point relate to the new information and communication technology .
this emerge sector be open up great access to the world of work for woman .
we must make sure the gap in this area be reduce .
we must make sure woman benefit from the new job generate , while avoid reproduce the inequality that exist in more traditional sector : less skilled job , part - time work ( sometimes not by choice ) , insecure contract and difficulty put in the way of access to decision - make post .
thirdly and finally , I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any community aid or funding be essential to promote equality .
because equality be a major political issue we be go to use a number of event to give it prominence during the french presidency .
I be primarily here today , of course , to discuss those event .
we have organise a ministerial conference in paris .
it will be hold on 27 october .
I have naturally invite mr rocard , my eminent fellow countryman , the chairman of the committee on employment and social affair , and mrs theorin , chair of the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity .
we will also be organise a conference on professional equality on 24 november , bring together expert , social partner and company manager , to look at the obstacle in the career path of woman .
I shall not , however , be talk about the conference on professional equality so much as the issue I have put on the agenda for the ministerial conference on 27 october .
three issue will be tackle , and they be issue also deal with in the presidency & apo ; s major document , either in the fifth action programme or the social agenda .
the three subject on the agenda for the ministerial conference be balanced participation by woman and man in decision - making , combine work and family life , and include equality in several structure of the european union council of minister .
the first issue , woman & apo ; s participation in decision - making in all area , show the serious deficit woman still suffer from today in comparison with man .
that be a democratic deficit which be less and less tolerate nowadays .
perhaps some of you remember the paris conference of april 1999 , when we reach agreement on a statement , but , with fifteen minister , have great difficulty decide on a plan of action with quantify target .
that be why I decide to seize the opportunity afford by the presidency & apo ; s major document , this time , to move that action plan forward .
I can tell you that my country have now mark a crucial milestone as regard woman & apo ; s participation in decision - making .
very briefly , a reform of the constitution be adopt on 28 june 1999 in france , with the support of the prime minister and the president of the republic , and immediately afterwards we begin debate a bill on parity , which be adopt on 3 may 2000 .
this law will be apply to all election , include local election from 2001 .
so , at the risk of see their electoral list invalidate or not have their campaign cost refund , the political party must present list with equal number of man and woman place alternately to prevent woman be relegate to position where they have little chance of getting elect .
I feel sure that balanced participation of woman in political decision - making would produce a genuine renewal of our whole political life .
such power sharing will bring with it other profound change in economic , social and cultural life .
the beijing platform for action and the final outcome document of the united nations general assembly special session on beijing + 5 , last june , be along the same line .
the finnish presidency & apo ; s report on woman and decision - making set out clear indicator for evaluate the progress make .
I also want to salute the commission & apos ; s initiative - I think my information be correct , mrs diamantopoulou - in take a decision to have parity between man and woman within its committee and group of expert .
we must all commit ourselves to follow and develop this encouraging initiative .
the french presidency would like to make progress in this matter and hope to approach its partner with proposal for quantify target for give woman access to decision - making in all area , the political arena , which I have already mention , but also economic and social sector .
initial consultation undertake by the french presidency confirm that this be a central concern in all member state .
I do not mean to imply that we have already reach agreement on the quantify target , but I can assure you I be put a good deal of effort into get that agreement .
the second issue for this ministerial conference will cover combine work and family life .
follow the example of finland , a questionnaire have be send to all the member state and this will be follow very shortly by a report .
a proposal on indicator to measure progress will be put before the council .
I be hope to make this issue an important one in the presidency & apo ; s programme so as to ensure continuity of the work do under the portuguese presidency .
I be think of the evora seminar on maternity and paternity and the resolution on balanced participation by man and woman in family life and at work .
because we know that as long as woman have to carry the burden of a double work day alone they will continue to face a dilemma between their private and family life and between their work life and their life as citizen .
indeed , as I always say in france , lady and gentleman , while a law to impose parity in politic be now within the bound of possibility , it be more difficult to impose parity in daily life , domestic parity , by law .
just as the public arena should not be a male monopoly , the private sphere should no long be the exclusive domain of woman .
that be why new method of organise time must be consider , so that all those involve - parent , child , citizen , elect representative , business - have their proper place .
this will be one of the strong point of the ministerial conference .
let I add that I have also put this item on the agenda of the conference on professional equality of 24 november .
the third issue for the ministerial conference will cover the incorporation of gender equality into the work of the various european union council of minister .
I hope to initiate a process I have use as a work method in france , a method that work well .
for the first time , several council of minister will be deal with gender equality by link it with one of the item on their agenda .
in addition to the ministerial conference and the conference on professional equality , I should also mention two very important document specifically devoted to equality , but within the area of competence of the employment and social affair council .
I be think of the fifth action programme and the amendment of the 1976 directive .
on the fifth action programme , I would first like to wholeheartedly thank mrs theorin and the rapporteur , mrs eriksson , for their work which will , I hope , make it possible to adopt the programme before the end of the year .
I know parliament will be particularly concerned about mainstreaming and the implementation of strategic objective relate to equality in economic and social life , and - to return to this point once again - balance participation in decision - making .
for my part , I undertake to ensure that the programme & apo ; s funding match up to our ambition .
by the same token , it fall to we to review the 1976 directive , 25 year after its adoption .
this review will not only bring the law into line with the many ruling from the court of justice , but will also incorporate other very important point into community legislation .
I be think , for example , of sexual harassment as gender - base discrimination .
the notion of indirect discrimination will be more precisely define and the derogation from equal treatment support well .
this be a particularly important advance for woman , as mrs hautala be sure to emphasise when she present her report to parliament on behalf of the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity .
go beyond the specific issue fall within the scope of my ministry , I want to mention three initiative , very briefly .
first of all , the guideline for employment , this time flesh out with quantify target , which propose to increase the employment rate for woman to 60 % by 2010 .
the role of the social partner be also strengthen , and I be very pleased about that .
finally , in a word , the fourth pillar devote to equal opportunity reinforce the integrate approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guideline .
the second initiative I want to mention relate to the social agenda to be submit to the nice summit , next december .
this be one of the presidency & apo ; s great priority and , as you know , it open up a broad field of action in employment , and clearly make the point that combine work and family life make a contribution to this .
personally , I would like to see this issue take into account even more specifically in the social agenda .
I think we can all congratulate ourselves on the fact that the agenda contain a chapter devote to the promotion of gender equality and , in that area too , I hope we will progress towards quantify target .
the last initiative I want to stress concern the drafting of the charter of fundamental right .
as you know , the draft be the outcome of complex negotiation which be complete on 26 september .
the document will be submit to the biarritz european council in a few day & apo ; time .
I shall stress our commitment to have the article relate to gender equality clearly set out in the charter .
I be frequently ask about this .
I know I have already use up my speak time so I shall be very brief , but there be a few thing I need to make clear .
three article in the charter be devoted to gender equality .
the first be devoted to the general principle of the equality of all person under the law .
the second relate to the principle of non - discrimination , include that base on gender .
the third affirm the principle of equal pay and equal treatment , together with the possibility of undertake positive action in favour of the under - represent sex .
combine work and family life , entitlement to pay maternity leave , right of a more general scope , such as the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity , also appear in the charter .
so all these provision make this document an additional instrument underpinning equality .
civil society & apos ; s expectation be high , and this have not escape the member of the convention , who be anxious to have a gender - correct charter .
in conclusion , I repeat that the community level be the right one for make progress together in all the area I have mention , but it be also the right level for make progress on many other issue of concern to woman .
I be think in particular of the violence they suffer , one of my priority for government action , and I know that be a specific issue that impel you to action too .
any progress we make in one member state be progress for the other member state .
if national policy be enrich by community policy , then community policy must also be inspire by national experience .
I be convinced that together - parliament , council and commission , but also member state , social partner and non - governmental organisation - we will make progress and I know - we know - that equality between woman and man be on the move .
mr president , I should like to begin by welcome mrs péry back to parliament .
those of we who have previously hear she in parliament know that , with she as president - in - office of the council , we have a very committed spokesperson for woman & apo ; s issue , and that be something we need if our plan be to succeed at all .
in the committee , we combine three report from the commission and deal with they together .
on behalf of the committee , I can promise that , in future , we shall attend to the report in time so that the commission do not feel it be engage on a major task , but that we in the committee be ignore the fact and not get our report ready in time .
we have promise ourselves that this will not happen in future .
this be something which , as woman , we should be pleased about .
there be really a paradox in the fact that we in the eu have , on the one hand , an outstanding basis for equality - especially now with the treaty of amsterdam - but that , on the other hand , there be fifteen man in the european council who make all the decision , something I shall refrain from comment far upon .
it therefore become obvious in one way or another that there be a difference between principle and concrete implementation .
I be also say this because I think it be incredibly important that the eu should be give a strong woman & apo ; s perspective , and I say this for two reason .
first of all , we have have a referendum in denmark which clearly show that woman , more than man , be oppose to this project , and not merely the project involve the euro but the eu project as a whole .
in denmark , we have equality in a great many area , so woman ought not to feel threaten by the project .
we see , however , that , on many point , woman be oppose to the project to a much great degree than man .
we therefore have some problem or other , and I will venture to say that it be not because we have decline to say that the eu be ok .
instead , it have to do with this overridingly male - dominate agenda , which woman have emotional reason for vote against .
secondly , we be now face enlargement , and we know that the progressive changeover from state - run to private enterprise affect woman more than man .
because a great many of the country have say that they want to hold referenda , we have the major task of conveying to woman in the candidate country that the eu be good for they .
for , if we do not make a special effort in this area , I be completely convinced that there will again be a range of emotional reaction which will not necessarily have to do with the eu clause but with the fact that the eu be , all in all , a very male - dominate enterprise .
in that way , there be a risk of our seeing & apo ; no & apos ; vote in referenda in the candidate country , too , and of enlargement fail to go ahead .
I would therefore prevail upon the president - in - office of the council , both the current and the forthcoming one , as well as upon the commissioner , to be alert to this aspect , for I believe that it be absolutely fundamental to our work that we make a very big effort in this area .
in connection with the report , I would also say - and the president - in - office of the council touch upon this , too - that one of the major problem in the eu be of course the big cultural difference .
it be therefore no wonder that the president - in - office of the council be have difficulty get her action plan through .
this clearly show that the country have very different interest , but one of the thing we have to work on be try to find out where , in particular , we can make a contribution in the individual country .
I have a dream of our be able to obtain proper statistic for the different area so that we can obtain indicator for the labour market , education and many other matter in relation to equality . in that way , we shall be able to work on thing in very much more concrete term .
I would very much recommend that this be do for the candidate country too , for it prove to be incredibly difficult to obtain figure from the candidate country about how responsibility be divide between man and woman in the different area .
I believe that , if we be to be able to deal with enlargement properly , we must also have those figure .
there be thousand of other thing I could have do with say . I can see , however , that my allocate speaking time have run out , so I shall stop at this point .
I would , however , put a strong case to the presidency and the commissioner for our continue to follow the guideline which we have indicate in the report and to which I have refer in my speech .
mr president , mrs péry , commissioner , the report that the commission have draw up on equal opportunity in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 be very important document and the reference to the treaty of amsterdam be a significant step forward .
article 2 and 3 of the treaty of amsterdam , cover equal opportunity for man and woman and article 141 cover positive measure for employment be a guarantee for woman that should take effect in all the policy of the european union .
we be aware that woman do not participate sufficiently in the decision - make process in politic , business or union .
they have a much small share in the labour market than man , a difference that be particularly accentuate in some country , especially in southern europe .
they do not receive the same pay for equal work , with the difference reach almost 30 % in the private sector .
we know that measure for combine family and work life particularly favour woman , although research be still need into the current situation of the family and the role that woman play in it , which be no long the traditional role , because society have change a great deal , and at the same time , so have family structure .
it be essential that research should be carry out on the real situation of woman in the various member state in order to guide the policy that need to be make if we be to achieve great equality between man and woman .
in order to integrate gender policy into all programme , we must be aware of the situation from which we be start and the objective that we wish to achieve with particular policy . because what really count be the achievement and the advance in the situation of woman .
we be aware that the majority of unemployment in the european union be among woman .
in order to achieve full employment , therefore , we need to have positive policy direct at woman , which will consist both of create job and of prepare woman for the new job - information society , new technology - in which they can play an entirely equal role to man .
the percentage of woman in work in the european union be much low than that in the united states and japan , a level that only some northern european country come close to .
if we take into account the candidate country , the problem become more serious as the level of woman worker in those country be even low . therefore , the objective of equality between man and woman should be include in all programme .
woman have decide that they wish to work , that they wish to make their work compatible with their family life .
woman wish to take part in decision - make process , in politic , union , and business , and we know that the contribution of woman be positive for everyone and for the progress of society as a whole .
european union policy should help they to take part in order to achieve great equality between man and woman .
mr president , minister , commissioner , lady and gentleman , contrary to what the annual report which we be discuss here might seem to suggest , european woman & apo ; s equality policy do not originate three year ago , but date back much far to at least twenty - five year ago .
its launch be accompany by a great deal of legal creativity , audacity and lashing of political power of persuasion .
if one examine woman & apo ; s equality policy now , it seem to I , as we be all gather here - and , of course , most of the people attend and take part in the discussion be woman - that while we be all naturally try our utmost , we be also aware that european woman & apo ; s equality policy be threaten to lose its momentum .
it have become an issue for which you have strong feeling neither for nor against .
to put it mildly , it be in a conceptual and political vacuum .
the report we be deal with here seem to reflect this mood .
there be a great deal of activity , reasonable sum be be spend , fantastic conference be be hold , everyone do all kind of wonderful thing , but we do not know where it be all lead .
be this policy a success ?
be it useful to draw the goal near ?
we can not verify this , for - and the rapporteur also mention this in her report - the goal of the policy be not clearly define and can not be measure .
what we need to do , therefore , be to formulate our goal more clearly , so that we know whether we be successful or whether the instrument we deploy be successful .
we also need to define the problem more clearly and identify the problem which the policy be try to solve .
twenty - five year ago , we be able to talk about social discrimination of woman as a group and about unequal treatment .
do this definition of the goal or problem still apply ? be it still appropriate ?
what be the group in society for which this definition be still appropriate ?
be it not the case that the gap cause by this social discrimination have be partly bridge for certain group and that other group be do very well indeed , in other word , that a kind of sham woman & apos ; s equality have be create ?
in short , I would very much like we to address the question as to what the problem face woman consist of .
what be the problem which the policy be try to solve ?
can we reframe this use a more modern approach and can we apply a theory and set of policy instrument which will breathe new life into the policy , so that we do not continue on the same path ?
I may be critical , but it might be useful to shake up the house of card , which woman & apo ; s equality policy in europe do appear to be , where we be all frightfully nice to each other and say everything be so wonderful .
mr president , minister , commissioner , I should like to start by thank our fellow mep , mrs dybkjær for an excellent report and welcome she back to parliament after her recent week & apo ; campaign .
we know that lone dybkjær do what she could .
I be a man in an eu within which man and woman do not have equal opportunity .
it be worth repeat that .
sometimes , some people - even colleague in this assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunity , but they do not .
just as some people have say , it be enough to look at this assembly : the majority be man , the majority of those make decision be man , and when the european council meet it consist solely of man .
there be one female head of state in europe .
it be therefore gratify that the european parliament be represent by a woman in these context .
more woman be need in decision - make position , because it be quite simply unacceptable that so much human ability be be lose .
woman do have the ability - and without impose quota .
this week we have take a great step close to a reunite europe .
emphasise how matter stand regard equality in the candidate country be a particularly important task in the membership negotiation that be currently in progress .
what can be do ?
rapid membership of the eu will provide economic strength , well condition for woman and great freedom of choice .
the chapter on equality must be accord equal importance in the membership negotiation .
there must be no transitional period .
we must monitor whether the directive on equality be really be incorporate into legislation .
mainstreaming be very important in the internal policy of the candidate country , too .
an ombudsman for equality issue should be introduce , and in the candidate country too .
the eu should pursue a campaign to combat violence against woman throughout eastern and central europe .
the eu should also take the initiative and organise a un convention against the trade in human being .
I start by talk about my male status .
perhaps this issue of gender need to be point out in this assembly .
I should like to conclude by say that equality begin in the home .
if we can not share task and responsibility in the small world of the home , there will never be real equality in the big world outside , either .
mr president , I greatly appreciate the fact that france , during its presidential term , have decide to issue parliament with a statement on equality .
this be , of course , no surprise , as we know that secretary of state péry be also extremely active in these matter in france .
she be quite right when she say that step take forward nationally can inspire we at eu level and , on the other hand , step take forward at eu level can give hint to the member state regard the direction they should go in .
it must also be say that france & apos ; s constitutional amendment to establish a policy of equal decision - making would perhaps be ideal as a source of inspiration not just in the member state , but perhaps also at european union level .
I know that in this we be get into a very sensitive area as we be step into what be almost like the member state & apos ; area of competence .
perhaps the big disappointment in this area with regard to the charter on fundamental right , as far as I be concern , be that the charter do not say that we should carry through the idea of equal representation of woman and man in decision - making .
however , this should have be incorporate in the charter quite naturally - in a modern society such as our - but this work will certainly have to be continue and go into in great detail .
péry speak of the importance of reconcile work with family life .
I be glad that she also mention that the method choose by finland be be use in france , in which quite clear indicator be identify to gauge the situation .
this will also perhaps serve as an answer for mrs swiebel , who be demand that we must be able to define clear target and that result must be able to be measure .
I believe that this method , which finland have introduce for the first time , work well in many area and while it be part of the commission & apos ; s strategy on equality there be good reason to expect much from it .
I would also like to mention one problem in the area of work and family life .
it would appear that it be get hard for young family to take advantage of the right that have be guarantee they by law , as competition in the job market have become so fierce .
we must be very careful that young mother and father do not freely surrender their right because they be afraid of the problem they might encounter in work life .
reference be also make here several time to mainstreaming , and I can only agree with what have be say here that , for example , in the area of economic policy it be of absolutely major importance to start consider the gender perspective .
the fact be , in denmark , woman suspect that the whole european integration project threaten the right and level of welfare woman have achieve there .
this , I think , present quite a challenge for both the commission and the council .
minister , commissioner , lady and gentleman , I be very pleased with the two report be debate today : mrs dybkjær & apos ; s report on progress so far , and mrs eriksson & apos ; s on the future . I find they both enormously interesting .
today , I simply want to talk specifically about what these report contain - our current objective as european in term of equal opportunity .
what emerge from these report be that it be difficult to move from theory to practice .
plenty of theory , plenty of fine word . no one be quick than we to say these thing or to come out with fine word , but practical result be a long time come .
why do this worry I ?
because I think there be currently great ambiguity and awkwardness about equal opportunity in europe .
we want specific action and we want mainstreame .
the two thing be not easily reconcile and we could lose out on both count .
for example , at noon we will be vote on two report on discrimination and equal access to employment which both exclude gender on the ground that gender be cover by policy other than discrimination policy .
I find that position awkward and ambiguous , and I think that mean more thought be require on the draft you be present to we , because there be no certainty that all this will produce practical result .
to take a very simple example , which we be just discuss three day ago in the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity , be we talk about defend flexibility or about fight poverty ?
both be possible , but they be also contradictory , because we know very well that flexibility create more poverty , and next week & apos ; s world march of woman will make that point .
so there be contradiction in our equal opportunity policy and I think we must be aware of that so that we can organise the future of our project well , or so it seem to I .
another example , also full of contradiction , be part - time work .
it appear in today & apos ; s report amongst the social right .
be access to part - time work a social right ?
I have no idea , but I doubt it .
on the other hand , there be also something in the report which seem to I very important and which mrs dybkjær have place well to the fore , as have mrs eriksson : the fact that in future we need to be concern about so - call & apo ; derive right & apo ; , that is , woman & apo ; s social right to autonomy .
what happen to a woman who have spend twenty year with a husband who then leave she ?
what sort of pension will she get ?
good question !
what be her tax position ?
there be no equal opportunity , there be no real equality for woman without autonomy and freedom as social right , so that they can have control of their life throughout their life .
I would like this subject , so strongly emphasise in our report , to be one of our priority from now on .
I now want to talk about enlargement , which be still , perhaps , one of my concern . we be delighted that the finnish presidency have introduce indicator and I know the french presidency want to consolidate this indicator policy into an important institution .
I be very pleased about that , I be delighted .
but look at the problem of enlargement , and here I will conclude , because the issue of enlargement worry I a great deal , yesterday we naturally vote in favour of the report on enlargement to a whole series of country .
but where , pray , be the condition for woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity in that enlargement ?
I be concerned about that and I urge the french presidency to be concern about it .
mr president , minister , commissioner , lady and gentleman , all of we here agree that equal opportunity for man and woman must be pursue in all our policy .
but beyond that , the method have to be define .
we need to be sure that what be decide in strasbourg be real progress .
in the name of equal opportunity , and thank to europe , french woman have win the right to work at night .
I be not sure they should thank europe for that .
the european method , impose uniformity , be wrong .
first , because while woman , like citizen in general , have the same idea of what be fair and what be unjust , they do not have the same idea about their role in the various culture of the european union .
nature have determine that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb .
now , the primary duty of any society be to promote life and hence do everything possible to enable woman to reconcile their legitimate right to personal and professional development with potential motherhood .
in that area , there be no equality .
only woman can have child .
so fairness do not come into the equation when the role of woman and man be as different as that .
rather than make abortion easy , the french government should be develop a policy aim at eliminate every material and social reason which might drive a woman to such a negation of life .
every abortion be a condemnation of our society , but never a condemnation of an individual woman .
since I become a member of this parliament , however , it have be my impression that a part of this house would rather forget this aspect of woman & apo ; s live .
more serious still , I also have the feeling that the institution of the european union have the great difficulty develop a global vision of society in our country .
as the debate and regulation go by , a compartmentalised vision of our society appear .
instead of address everyone , we compartmentalise : minority after minority , ethnic group after ethnic group .
as a french woman and citizen , this vision of the world be particularly alien to I .
I be a citizen who should enjoy the same right and the same prospect as any citizen of the other sex , no more and no less .
I do smile sometimes in this house , particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency be woman , especially in denmark .
when we decide on policy target people with disability , or blind people , it be perfectly normal to add woman .
it be really very annoying that these woman , from the depth of their kitchen or household account , be reject the radiant future of the euro .
they must be re - educate .
the image of the european woman we find in the page of our report and directive do not correspond to that of these danish woman , the majority of whom be say no to the euro .
so , new page describe she as ill informed , isolated , and out of step with everyone else .
danish woman will appreciate that .
I take this opportunity to salute the danish woman member of parliament , especially ulla sandbaek and pia kjaersgaard . they come from different political background , but together they embody the courage so many man lack .
it be my conviction that a method be be outline today through policy gear to sector , not to say minority , in this parliament .
any kind of national attachment must be destroy , european society must be reduce to a collection of isolate individual in small ethnic , sexual , social or other minority , all run from a distance by a european state as distant as it be pernickety .
it be not surprising , therefore , that mrs dybkjær & apos ; s report refer to the beijing platform , which use woman & apo ; s right as a weapon to defend a particular conception of woman and their right , and impose it on the whole world .
the polish delegation to the new york conference already have occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the european delegation incapable of accept other position more measure than its own .
other member of this parliament have to take up the pen to put thing right , and poland thank they for it .
in spite of these remark , we shall vote for this report because we be naturally in favour of equal opportunity , but what equal opportunity mean most of all be respect for everyone .
mr president , mrs péry , commissioner , the position of , and relationship between , man and woman in society have change dramatically over the past decade .
the number of dual earner household have grow considerably .
give this development , we applaud a policy which contribute towards the equivalent development of man and woman in line with their talent and interest .
the present report , however , put forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality .
the diversity or difference with regard to man and woman be still not be give enough consideration .
there be also the freedom of the individual to consider .
as a result , the freedom of choice for woman , which they strive for , can very easily fuel frustration and renew form of repression .
I therefore find it tell that the report be seek to establish a numerical balance between man and woman across all sector of society , for example in the labour market .
the choice of training and profession for man and woman will depend on their own personality , talent and interest .
to respect and value these difference show that we still have our foot firmly on the ground .
the campaign launch by the dutch government to encourage girl to select more exact science subject and so - call male profession , have fail miserably .
a european repeat of these debacle appear completely pointless to I .
I just have to get something off my chest . I find it shock that the representative of the council should mention the fact that equality should be enforce , yes enforce , would you believe , in the home .
I do hope that she share my view that the government have no right to intervene in the private sphere .
in addition , the report undervalue transductive labour .
bring up child , especially transfer standard and value , be of vital importance to our society .
whoever deny mother the freedom of choice to bring up their own child unpaid , will be present with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism .
the idea that woman lag behind in pay work compare to man should certainly not be consider as inequality , because it be base on a one - sided , woman - unfriendly vision .
after all , it be the cool , rational , enlighten thinking which advance human being as independent , autonomous creature and downgrade woman to be the second sex .
when one adopt this thinking as starting point , it be easy to see why one could be in favour of woman & apo ; s equality .
this choice , however , do not offer any guarantee against evil , suffering or injustice .
at good , it sustain other type of suppression .
human being be independent and responsible creature place in relation to god , their creator , on the one hand and their fellow human being on the other .
this mean , among other thing , that man and woman interrelate and need each other in order to do themselves justice as man and woman .
this be exactly why keep marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represent a lose opportunity .
mr president , lady and gentleman , it be certainly a sensible initiative on the part of the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity to compile a report on the commission & apos ; s annual report concern equal opportunity for man and woman in the european union , cover the period from 1997 to 1999 .
that be over 40 year ago .
after all , we be already discuss the fifth action programme on the equal treatment of man and woman .
mrs dybkjær & apos ; s report contain another long list of demand and wish direct at the commission , particularly in respect of inquiry , which I do not , however , necessarily consider to be indispensable .
once again , we have be leave in no doubt on that score .
what I do not see in this report , commissioner , be call for the commission to at last get round to follow up parliament & apos ; s very specific proposal .
we have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposal from the commission , than we do for study and fine declaration and speech .
firstly , improvement be call for in the exist directive , for example those cover equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security , with respect to public and company scheme .
I would remind you , in this connection , of our report on the splitting of pension right in the event of divorce , as a result of which , payment for survive relative and the retirement age be to be include in the 1979 directive .
I would put you in mind of the overdue improvement make to the & apo ; caffeine - free & apos ; free directive of 1986 concern equal right for self - employ people , include spouse that help out - those million of invisible worker , most of whom be woman - and whom be engage in small and medium - sized agricultural enterprise without any form of social security .
five year ago , we unanimously adopt an excellent report on this subject , one of our demand be a framework statute for spouse that help out in the family business .
there be two session of round - table talk organise by the commission , and we have not hear another word since .
that be three year ago .
what we really need be for the commission to at last come up with concrete , legislative proposal , instead of fritter away time and money on report and inquiry , and waste time that would be well spend on worthwhile legislative work .
the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity would also do well to take this advice to heart .
mr president , I would like to thank mrs nicole péry for give we high hope of the french presidency , which have make great stride with its law on equality .
electoral list comprise 50 % man and 50 % woman could be worth emulate .
however , we be still await the decision regard a formal council of minister .
unfortunately , we be only ever refer to other council of minister for a decision .
we do not want to wait any long .
other speaker have make the point : we want political action .
it be high time for decision on equal pay for equal work , i.e. for article 141 and 13 to be implement .
the charter of fundamental right have to be more than a fine proclamation .
what we need be concrete implementation measure that will enable people to reconcile a career with family life .
the fifth action programme will assist we in this , but we as a european parliament have already come some way ourselves .
we have create a network of committee on equality with our female counterpart in the national parliament , and in november , we will be meet our female counterpart from the member state , as well as those from the candidate country .
we do the same thing , incidentally , in new york , at the beijing + 5 conference .
I be the rapporteur in peke and the co - rapporteur in new york .
the polish woman be very grateful to we for make it clear that the representative who be there at the time most definitely do not reflect the view of polish woman .
I meet with some very positive response there .
I would like to remind our president of the commission , mr prodi , of the important speech he make here .
there must be no glass ceiling in the european edifice .
the european parliament employ 30 % woman , which be the high percentage rate of all the institution .
the commission have 25 % woman , so at least there be an upward trend .
the european court of justice could do well , as only two of its fifteen judge be woman .
yes , and the picture look very gloomy in the council on the equal opportunity policy front .
all I can say there , be that the council be what you might call a develop country where equality for woman be concerned .
we have every reason to be concern .
we have hear that the previous council presidency first restructure and then scrap the ministry for equality .
that give we great cause for concern , and we expect that as well as step up the pace in matter of equal opportunity policy , there will also be concrete measure .
mr president , the commission report on equal opportunity be very welcome , but unfortunately , as the rapporteur say early , in a practical sense they be not very useful as real measure of success or basis on which to build future programme , because they be too descriptive and there be not enough analysis of success and failure .
one of the vital requirement for improvement in the position of woman be firstly to know exactly what the current situation be .
that mean we need accurate fact and figure .
then the evaluation report can use clear criterion and give we an objective analysis of progress or the lack of progress .
after all , one of the main criticism that I receive from grassroots woman & apos;s organisation be that when apply for financial support from the european union , they have to make very detailed prediction about their future work and its outcome .
yet in report like this , we do not have anything like the same detailed information .
we need to ensure that information and activity reach woman in their own community , and one effective way of do that would be by develop and promote real life case study which reflect a positive image .
I try to look at these report from the point of view of woman in wale , the constituency I represent , and consider how they be affect by this kind of progress and how they can get access to and use this kind of information .
I would support the request of the committee on woman & apos;s right in this report for a major study of woman in the eu and in the candidate country as a starting point for future work .
a lot be be do by woman & apos;s organisation , by government , by the european parliament and the commission .
we have hear from the minister of the progress that have be make in france and we can learn a lot from this .
great involvement by woman at all level of government and in all area of life be essential for deepen democracy and achieve and maintain peace .
we should be encourage well dialogue with woman everywhere - after all the european union be see as a pioneer in term of equality legislation .
the report be welcome and the progress they outline be a step forward , but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistic , we be not in a position to judge whether we be on the right road to achieve real equality between woman and man .
mr president , commissioner , mrs péry , lady and gentleman , as the commission & apos ; s report acknowledge , major issue still remain to be resolve in the field of equal opportunity for man and woman .
in practically every sphere of activity , serious inequality still exist .
despite the differ situation in member state , there be generally few woman in the labour market , they be most affect by unemployment , include long - term unemployment , and by casual labour , part - time work and atypical , insecure and badly pay work .
woman & apo ; s average salary be still low than man & apo ; s , by around 28 % on average , which be a contributory factor to woman make up the bulk of the poor and to prevent they from participate in social and political life .
with regard to participation in the decision - make process , either at political level , in the business world or in the trade union movement , woman be still in the minority .
madam president - in - office , thank you for come here today to tell we about the french presidency & apo ; s interesting initiative .
I should like to dwell in particular on two term : articulation between family and work and parité au quotidien .
these concept and what they stand for be gain ground in french society and I hope that this interest will be export to the rest of europe .
I also want to congratulate you on your initiative in introduce the female dimension into the council because , as we see on a daily basis , woman & apo ; s issue be special issue , not just a necessary dimension to every policy .
as far as the commission report be concern , commissioner , we receive they with interest and we examine they in the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity . however , I have to say that we be dissatisfied with the descriptive nature of the report and trust that future report which come under your responsibility will contain a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the result .
my final comment concern the situation of woman in the country prepare to join the european union .
because of the course of our own history and our experience from the policy which we have apply , we have an obligation to help they and I therefore feel that the commission and the council should call on the member state to adopt the mechanism which allow equality to be apply to all their policy .
we have both a political and a moral responsibility for these country try to find their way into europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged europe which we be prepare .
mr president , welcome back to parliament , mrs péry .
thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have make a point of do in the interest of equality .
we be especially look forward to your succeed in implement a policy of alternate listing of woman and man in decision - making .
that be really excellent .
I would just like to raise a couple of issue which I believe should , as a matter of urgency , be a part too of the council & apos ; s think and of the work it be do .
it concern not only woman in the european union , but also woman in the candidate country .
in the candidate country , the social exclusion of woman have be substantially great than that of man . it be therefore woman who have be hard hit .
many of they have lose their job and , with this , come violence against woman , sex discrimination and the trade in woman .
many woman be lure to western europe with promise of a well life , but the reality be the opposite .
they often fall victim to act of violence and some be force into prostitution .
consequently we must demand and support preventive programme and specific measure , such as strict legislation , witness protection scheme and information campaign .
however , the fact that the exist law be not enforce and new one be not create mean that the government of europe be indirectly allow the mafia to continue with its activity .
this be therefore an incredibly important issue for we to get to grip with .
in this area therefore , the council , especially its man , have a tremendously important job to do in lead europe in the fight against the mafia that trade in woman , for this slave trade be not something that responsible politician can push aside , shrug off or ignore .
we have a political responsibility to abolish this slavery of modern time .
in conclusion , I would like to say something about the man - and it be the man that I address .
when I talk about & apo ; the man & apo ; , I mean the man with power .
it be prodi , chirac , jospin , schröder , blair , persson and the other who must become involved in this , namely all 15 of our head of government .
mr president , the recital of this report highlight aspect of gender inequality .
woman be force into temporary work , they be far more expose to insecure job and unemployment , and on average they be pay 30 % less than man .
unfortunately , the proposal that follow do not measure up to the challenge of those recital .
firstly , because the majority of they be about create monitoring centre , collect statistic and carry out study .
gender inequality be not exactly a new phenomenon we be just discover , need to be study .
as regard work , we can not seek equality and continue to develop insecurity , flexibility and part - time work .
that be part - time work that woman be force into , because 70 % of they would like to work full - time .
today we be witness the pauperisation of wage - earn woman all over europe , include france , where 15 % of they live on less than frf 3 650 a month .
bad , so - call equality be sometimes turn against woman : for instance , in france today the incorporation of a directive be go to make night work legal for woman .
a strange notion of equality .
other choice could have be make ; night work for man could have be ban instead , when it be not require to meet society & apos ; s need .
in conclusion , fine word and nothing concrete .
that will not be enough .
that be what we will be say in brussels on 14 october with the world march of woman fight against violence and for real work for all .
those be the essential condition for real equality .
mr president , I would like to thank both mrs péry and commissioner diamantopoulou for be here today .
from the report and speech that we be consider today we can deduce , as many of we already know , that the problem of equal opportunity be a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategy , because as woman we be not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group .
in the european union we be currently run the risk of our debate be elitist and of the progress only reach some of the more informed and more privileged woman , leave behind the rest , who be young woman , immigrant woman , single mother , victim of the white slave trade , etc . they suffer from multiple discrimination .
we can not continue with an elitist debate , we can not continue to have progress only benefit those woman who enjoy great opportunity .
our effort need to be direct at the woman who have the most problem , who be certainly the majority in the european union .
we therefore need to assess the real situation of woman , we need to draw up indicator and we need to make our political action bind , so that progress really reach everyone and not just a few .
commissioner , lady and gentleman , I wish first of all to congratulate the french presidency on initiate this debate . I should also particularly like to congratulate our former vice - president , who be fully aware of the problem we face in this house and of the great interest that the european parliament take in the debate on issue of equality between man and woman .
as the minister quite rightly say , we be discuss a political issue of the great importance and it be crucial that europe understand that we be argue that equality be just such an issue .
I should also like to congratulate mrs péry , as a french politician , on the coherence show in her own country , which amend its constitution to include equality between man and woman . it also then succeed in introduce and approve a law to implement this .
not all country have manage to follow france & apos ; s example , which I hope will bear fruit elsewhere .
I should like to say , mrs péry that I consider the fact that you be organise a council of minister for woman & apo ; s affair and that every government in the european union have one member responsible for equal opportunity issue to be of the utmost importance .
this be the only way in which & apos ; mainstreaming & apo ; can be introduce across the board in government and in which the equal opportunity policy will gain the high profile necessary to give it substance .
I shall end , mrs péry , by ask you a question .
as the ministry of equal opportunity in portugal be now defunct , who will represent my country at the meeting on 27 october in paris ?
mr president , I too would like to thank minister péry and commissioner diamantopoulou for today & apos;s debate . I would also like to thank the rapporteur , whose report not only contain observation on the situation of equal opportunity in the european union , but also recommend a course of action .
I would particularly like to thank the minister for the work she be do in her own country and as president - in - office of the council , and I would like to make a connection between the work of the presidency - in - office of the council and the work of the commission , focus on one point : employment .
the report before we be , I feel , a major synergistic work . the guideline for 2001 on equal opportunity in the world of employment be start to become well define , more specific and more effective .
this be the way forward .
the committee on woman & apos;s right would like to congratulate the commission and also propose a few even more specific pointer .
I truly believe that this report and the fifth action programme which lay down a strategy be the way forward .
we might do well to stop complain , or rather to complain but , at the same time , to show due appreciation for the positive step which be be take to ensure that we make increasingly effective progress .
mr president , I will not reply individually , except to mrs torre marque , because her question be really direct and personal .
I be indeed sorry to see that maria de belém roseira be no long the representative .
she be very active during the portuguese presidency , but it be not up to I to make that decision , it be up to the minister for employment , whom we have invite to the conference on gender equality .
I will now respond generally on the issue , rather than give individual answer to any one of you .
several of you have say gender equality policy do not start a year , two year , or three year ago .
obviously not , and as someone involve with association for social change - because I too , like many of you , have some thirty year of involvement with these association behind I - I know how hard the social movement , the feminist movement and the intellectual movement , naturally , have work to move this issue forward , and today we take our place in role of responsibility in our institution .
the history of the woman & apo ; s movement go back way over fifty year : I sometimes remember olympe de gouge , who dare to call for a declaration of woman & apo ; s right and gender equality , and be condemn to the scaffold in 1793 .
of course the history of feminism be very long .
my second comment be about inequality in the world of work .
lady and gentleman , political will be clearly not enough to eliminate every possible social inequality overnight , especially in the world of work .
management , the union and the market have a role to play , but we do what we can by express a political will .
I can tell you in one sentence what I be do about it : I have waste no time propose a law to improve equality in the world of work .
this be currently be debate in parliament , and I have introduce a provision , which obviously do not suit everyone in my country , but which be compulsory and will compel each company or profession to negotiate on equality in the workplace every three year , cover salary , condition of work , career prospect , and access to lifelong training .
my third comment be about your doubt : plenty of speech , plenty of document , plenty of report , but not enough actual progress towards quantify target .
it be true that the reality in the european union be that we have to take decision as fifteen and we differ culturally in relation to these issue .
nevertheless , I believe in the need to fight for quantify target , and to implement policy through indicator .
I do not mention this in my speech , but I be fully intend to propose a feasibility study on the gender institution to the ministerial conference , because we need an instrument for monitor those indicator , and for exchange of good practice .
fourth point : the issue of the future .
two of you mention new social right , new fiscal right .
I can tell you that will be the central theme of the swedish presidency , and I shall be follow it with great interest , because the progress make will certainly inspire french action .
fifth point : the charter .
it be true that while much have be do compare with the initial stage of this document , we might have hope for something more dynamic on decision - making .
I have not lose hope , however , of improve the text .
sixth point : enlargement .
in new york I take the liberty of make myself clear on that issue on behalf of my country .
I shall be just as clear today , on behalf of the presidency .
the candidate really must be help to come up to the level of the acquis communautaire .
that seem clear .
exclude gender equality from the acquis communautaire be unimaginable , and of course we shall be just as vigilant on that issue as on the other .
finally , violence , prostitution , the grip of the mafia . if mrs diamantopoulou want to take a european initiative , because we have do thing before at community level to combat violence , I shall be there to support she .
mr president , what we refer to here and what have be refer to for a century as the woman & apo ; s problem be approach from two different angle , as the debate here in the house today have demonstrate .
the first reason that the structure of the social and economic system be to blame for present inequality and the policy of the european union and of all the national government be base on this reasoning .
the second approach say that woman , themselves , be to blame for the inequality which exist in society .
this reasoning often lead to absurd distortion , one of which be hear here today , i.e. that the way in which woman vote in denmark be determine by some particular female chromosome and not by the social difference which they experience on a daily basis .
honourable member , mrs péry , the president - in - office , have give we a superb analysis of the priority of the french presidency , which we all believe will be particularly important priority .
I should like in my brief intervention to confine myself to the report .
the 97 , 98 and 99 report be not simply work paper .
they be political tool .
I should like to remind the house that the commission & apos ; s legislative proposal due for debate call for annual report from the member state on the subject of positive action because we really do believe that these report be political tool for three reason .
firstly , they give we a picture of the situation .
as you will have see , the report contain analytical table , datum on each member state and table on all the individual sector .
secondly , because they allow we to make a comparative assessment of the member state and a comparative assessment of the overall progress of the european union over time .
thirdly , because they form the basis for strategy , both for the european union - even in the charter of fundamental right the fact that we have a picture of the current situation play an important role - and at national level , give that the member state be able to use the comparative assessment to set national target .
in my view , the report which you have at your disposal concentrate on and highlight three issue . the first be the participation of woman in decision - making .
the average participation of woman be 18.6 % in europe , 28.9 % in regional parliament and 30 % in parliament and there appear to be a very minor increase in the order of 0.6 % from one year to the next .
the second interesting comment concern the wage differential between man and woman which , at european level , be hover at the unacceptable level of 23 % to 24 % and , in some region of europe , be as high as 40 % .
the third interesting statistic concern domestic violence , the violence which woman suffer at european level .
I fully accept the comment in the report and the recommendation by member who have speak of the need to change the nature of the report .
I have take your comment on board and I see that we need to concentrate on analyse datum , especially the result of successful strategy and successful initiative at national and european level , in order to give the report a strategic slant .
however , I need your help here .
my service face huge problem collect datum from national government .
there be several country , although one could cite example for all country , where it be impossible for we to collect statistic , where it be impossible for we to collect their experience and result at national level from innovative policy in time .
I believe that , if you work together with your national government , you can help the commission to collate this datum quickly , so that it in turn can present an analysis of they in the sort of report which you require .
finally , as far as enlargement be concern , it be of course , as mrs péry have say , a question of acquis communautaire .
however , I would stress that , in work with each of the candidate country , we have be closely monitor the question of sexual equality , as regard both the legislative framework and the creation of institution which can support the application of these policy .
as you know , we have start sign joint report with each candidate country in order to monitor their adjustment to employment policy on an annual basis .
they contain an entire chapter devote to the participation of woman .
I should like , once again , to thank mrs dybkjær for the excellent , in - depth work contain in her report , which will be most useful to we in our next report , and I should like especially to thank the french presidency and mrs péry for be so pro - active on the issue of equality during their presidency .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
community custom code
mr president , commissioner , this morning we will approve the council common position definitively adopt this reform of the community custom code .
it could be think , give that parliament have not table amendment to the council common position , that we have before we a perfect text .
that be not the case , but it be a satisfactory text and , having give it great thought and follow an extensive debate , the committee on legal affair and the internal market decide not to table any amendment .
what be the reason for this ?
we need a little history .
the reform of the community custom code be enshrine in article 253 of the current code and a reform be plan for before 1 january 1998 .
we be therefore somewhat behind schedule .
this reform be important because it aim to re - examine the community custom code in accordance with the progress of the internal market and of administrative technique .
it be therefore an important and urgent reform in a sector that , as we be all well aware , be the real core of european construction .
build a common custom system have be one of the major achievement in that progress towards european construction .
at first reading , in the paasilinna report , parliament adopt thirteen amendment of vary importance , which also meet a variety of fate when they subsequently go to the council .
in its joint position that be definitively and unanimously adopt , the council incorporate eight amendment and reject five .
I be not go to comment on the eight amendment that be adopt , as we be all in agreement with they .
I be go to discuss the five amendment that be not incorporate .
three of they - amendment nos 4 , 5 and 7 , refer to the commitology procedure .
these amendment need to be consider in the new context of the interinstitutional agreement , and therefore , parliament can agree to not insist on these commitology amendment give that they have be supersede to a certain extent by the new interinstitutional framework .
with amendment no 15 , parliament wish to introduce a recital urge the custom authority to apply custom rule correctly , to establish monitoring measure in order to ensure that it be apply consistently and to facilitate action against fraud .
the council consider that it be not draft suitably in order to be include in the community custom code and point out that there be a green paper - which be currently be convert into rule - specifically for combat fraud .
we be therefore also able to accept this amendment not be incorporate .
finally , amendment no 11 request that this modification to the community custom code enter into force before 1 january 2000 and be , therefore , no long valid .
aside from these amendment , it should be consider that the common position modify the original text on which parliament have agree on two important point : the first be article 220 , in which the commission aim to maintain a long period for conduct the investigation that could lead to a prosecution for fraud or a wrongful declaration .
the committee on legal affair and the internal market , follow a long debate , consider that it be not reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty for a period of six year , and that three year , which be the period set , be a more reasonable period of time for establish , with the appropriate mean and the average proceeding , whether or not there be irregularity in a declaration .
with regard to the modification of paragraph 6 of article 215 , it should be say that we be deal with a deep issue , because the intention be that the additional declaration could be make anywhere in the european union , especially wherever in the european union the undertaking in question have its headquarters .
mr president , in the increasingly open economic climate in which the european union must operate , and give the need to establish trade relation that ensure the competitiveness of undertaking , it be crucial that we establish a legal framework that set the same rule of play for everyone .
in this sense , the community custom code be an essential support for the european union & apos ; s trade policy , as well , as we be already aware , as be an essential instrument for protect the union & apos ; s financial interest .
the progress make on the internal market , the gradual growth in trade due to the increase opening up of the market and the progress of the information society mean that the community custom code need to be bring up to date with the development of community and international trade .
hence the need for and the timeliness of the reform that be propose at the time with the aim of simplify and rationalise custom procedure , precisely in response to the demand of the new reality that I have mention .
on the other hand , it be also necessary , as I understand it , to establish effective monitoring measure to ensure the uniform application of custom procedure across the whole of the community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loophole that could facilitate fraud .
as the rapporteur point out , however , neither the council nor the commission adopt the specific amendment that I have mention , because , among other reason , they consider that they do not add anything to the propose text and that fraud should be combat outside the community custom code .
the committee on legal affair and the internal market , as the rapporteur point out , accept that approach , and therefore decide not to re - introduce the amendment .
I must therefore regret that they be not take into consideration , although I also understand the position of the committee on legal affair and the internal market - the position of the rapporteur - of not re - introduce the amendment because , ultimately , what really matter be that the community custom code and the propose reform move forward and that the legal framework be establish .
let we hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantee .
mr president , I believe that both the rapporteur and mrs ferrer have highlight the main point of parliament & apos ; s position and the legislative procedure to date , and they have point out how the council , parliament and the commission have work together in order to arrive at a text that be correct and acceptable to everyone .
I think that , once again , the conciliation procedure , which mean agreement between the institution , be work properly .
however , there be an amendment that the council rightly reject .
it be amendment no 15 , on fraud .
a custom code be not the place for establish rule on fraud .
that be something that depend on the correct functioning of administration and , clearly , in a legislative debate we should not be discuss the subject of fraud .
take advantage of the fact that the commissioner responsible for the internal market , mr bolkestein , be here , I would like to point out that a few year ago the european parliament establish its first committee of inquiry , which be to investigate fraud in the transport of good .
there be a report by mr bouwman , an excellent report that we adopt , in which considerable fraud be reveal , for example , in the case of tobacco .
there be good , particularly tobacco , which be enter through a non - community country in the european economic area zone , go through the community zone and then mysteriously leave the community zone on paper , but without actually leave .
currently , for example , there have be a drop in the price of banana in the european union .
it seem that multinational company be place their excess banana , those that they do not sell in the united states and europe , in eastern europe . from eastern europe , certain & apos ; charitable & apo ; organisation , that be mafia , introduce these banana , which be practically give to they , into the community market , compete with the price of legal importer and community producer .
we could also mention the ongoing fraud in tomato , in which we see price be continually undervalue because good be be introduce through certain community port without authorisation .
if we want third country to accept commitment , the european community must be the most zealous in ensure that its own rule be be comply with , because if a country have the opportunity to place product in the community by mean of smuggling , why be it go to bother to negotiate with we for any sort of concession ?
I therefore welcome the fact that we have reach an agreement on this subject .
I think that the modification be very positive , but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the commission for great vigilance and for strict measure on fraud in community custom .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , although it be true that the text be flawed , as the chairman of the committee on legal affair and the internal market and the rapporteur have already underline , I would still venture to suggest that this legislative resolution be an example of transparent , simplified and efficient community legislation .
after all , in the community custom code , a successful attempt have be make to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner , which surely must always be the objective .
I can only applaud the customs code , and I be , therefore , somewhat more positive than mrs ferrer , for example , for it indeed form the basis of various area of community policy within the framework of community action of the national custom authority .
in broad term , the community custom code be one of the most important legal instrument for establish the amount of outstanding duty and to establish to whom these be due .
the code form the legal basis for levy these duty and , as such , one of the key instrument for protect the financial interest of the community and for ensure the smooth running of the community policy in different area .
in short , I believe I can safely say that the administration now have all the possible lever at its disposal in order to fulfil its task efficiently and within the timeframe provide , and I assume that the european parliament can invite the administration to make the result of this legislative resolution feel as soon as possible .
mr president , I would like to ask the commission to adopt a position on the request make in the legislative resolution for the appropriate measure to be take in order for there to be a modification of the community custom code , as mention by mr beysen and as I have also express .
mr president , may I start by extend a warm thank to the committee on legal affair and the internal market for the work it have carry out on the basis of mrs palacio & apos ; s report this report encompass all the question which form the subject of debate at first reading in march of last year .
I welcome the major overture which have be make with regard to this dossier , which have be the subject of long and intense discussion within the council .
I be pleased to note that it be possible to dismiss the reservation express by parliament due to issue of comitology with regard to various proposal .
this open the door to a major reform of economic custom system , on which , in fact , parliament will be inform in detail in the next couple of month prior to approval .
in the same way , the amendment table by parliament regard paperless declaration , adopt by the council , will enable member state custom authority to have state - of - the - art automate administration equipment at their disposal .
thank to the initiative take by parliament at first reading , the most wish - for outcome within economic circle be the compromise of good faith , as a result of which it will be possible to strike a well balance between the operator & apo ; need for legal certainty and the need for efficient protection of the financial interest of the community .
that have be , as be know , the outcome of a long debate in the council , during which debate the commission staunchly defend its view .
it come as no surprise that this point form an integral part of the dossier and that the dossier have be approve unanimously .
take into consideration the delicate position in which the dossier now find itself , I be of the opinion that the outcome of a conciliation procedure , assume that the debate be extend , would have be quite uncertain .
it be true that the commission would have wish to take matter one step far .
but it can at the same time validate the result achieve and keep some point of its proposal in reserve , which can then be bring up for discussion again at the appropriate time .
in this spirit , the commission be able to endorse the positive balance - sheet of this legislative operation .
it would like to thank parliament and the committee chair by mrs palacio , in particular , for the effort make and interest show by parliament and the committee with regard to this dossier .
finally , in direct response to the question raise by both mr beysen and mrs palacio , I can confirm , on behalf of the commission , that we will be only too pleased to meet and carry out that request .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
( the sitting be suspend at 11.50 a.m. and resume at 12.05 p.m. )
vote
mr president , I want to speak before you take that vote to explain why I want member to vote against the amendment .
yesterday the whole position change with the position the commission have take on the legal base .
but it be too late now because you have just take the vote and member vote in favour of it .
we will just have to press on .
I be sorry about that .
( parliament adopt the legislative resolution )
this be also very sad for thousand of student and other involve in education across europe .
I be sure the commission and the house will have note what you say .
welcome
it give I great pleasure to welcome the president of the international olympic committee , mr juan antonio samaranch .
the 27th olympiad in sydney , which have just end , be regard by everyone as a major success , attract million of spectator from all over the world .
mr samaranch , we know you take up your post as ioc president in 1980 , and since then , have introduce many important reform .
sport should promote peace and human understanding , and I just want to mention a few important initiative which have be take under your presidency .
finally , I would like to mention the launch of the international olympic truce centre in july 2000 in athens which be create through a joint initiative of the international olympic committee and the greek ministry of foreign affair with a view to promote the olympic ideal .
this centre be symbolically base in greece where the first olympics take place and where the next olympic game in 2004 will be hold .
mr president , we be delighted to welcome you to the european parliament and we hope you enjoy your visit .
vote ( continuation )
mr president , we be just about to start the vote on the mann report and I want to draw your attention to the fact that there appear to be a translation problem in amendment no 63 from the tdi group .
I note there it be submit in italian but in the english language it say that & quot ; discrimination which require man to wear a tie should be outlaw & quot ; .
this must be a translation problem because I be certain that the tdi group would not want to trivialise such an important piece of legislation on equal right by introduce such a frivolous and unnecessary amendment .
perhaps you could get your service to check this .
we will look into that .
mr president , this be on a mistake in translation too , though not as important as the one just mention .
in amendment no 24 , the word & apo ; difficulté injustifiée & apos ; in the french version be a mistranslation .
I trust this will not change the way we vote , but the french translation really must be check .
the word in the english version be the authentic one .

report ( a5 - 0211 / 2000 ) by mr titley , on behalf of the committee on foreign affair , human right , common security and defence policy , on the council & apos;s 1999 annual report on the implementation of the eu code of conduct on arm export ( 11384 / 1999 - c5 ­ 0021 / 2000 - 2000 / 2012 ( cos ) )

explanation of vote- recommendation for second reading palacio vallelersundi ( a5 - 0254 / 2000 )
- ( de ) experience show that the economic operator want to have the option of pay import duty in the place where their headquarters in the union be locate .
we independent therefore support - above all , in the interest of enable the internal market to function successfully - the demand of the committee on legal affair and the internal market , for the commission to draft a legislative proposal concern the place in which the custom debt be incur .
report evans ( a5 - 0255 / 2000 )
mr president , I vote in favour of the evans report .
I would like to start by congratulate the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on employment and social affair , mr mantovani , on the substantial amendment he table to the commission communication , a communication which , among other thing , relate to the movement of young student and young researcher within the european community .
I say & apos ; young & apos ; , and therefore the pensioner and elderly people , whose interest I be try to protect , should not have to concern themselves with this directive .
but time wait for no man : one day the young people will become old people as well ; the young researcher will also grow old and , it be to be hope , pensioner .
I therefore welcome the amendment which call upon the commission to treat period of study and research as if the student and researcher be pay social security contribution , as this will increase the pension of student and researcher .
mr president , in my opinion , robert j. evans & apos ; s report be very important and I vote in favour of it .
the right of freedom of movement of european citizen be still be violate in many way .
student in particular often encounter barrier and difficulty in member state that should no long occur under eu legislation .
study by the european commission show that needless red tape be cause problem for student from other eu country .
residence permit be grant for just short period of time and it be awkward and costly to renew they .
there be some unfortunate situation .
in spain student be require to deposit - in a spanish bank account , note - special sum of money that act as a guarantee in order to rent accommodation .
it be also complicated to arrange for student & apo ; family to move .
recently it come out that certain estate agent handle rent accommodation in london would not accept a foreign , for example , a finnish , guarantor that ensure the finnish student & apo ; s rent would be pay .
european right of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation .
this be not the first time I have express my view on mobility for student and teacher .
we be already condemn the financial difficulty face erasmus student during the last session .
everyone agree that this mobility must be encourage in the name of the free movement of person , but also and especially because of all the benefit to the young citizen of europe and hence the european union .
unfortunately , in practice , the obstacle be still there .
that be what the commission proposal deplore and the evans report confirm .
accord to the recommendation , base on article 149 and 150 of the treaty , member state need to be encourage to adopt measure which will steadily remove the exist difficulty , and the citizen of the union should be offer a platform of right lead to real mobility .
while this proposal be a step in the right direction it still contain a number of gap which the evans report remedy .
thus , it include researcher within the scope of the recommendation .
I think that this be crucial , give that its importance be constantly emphasise in the context of build a european research area .
mr evans also demonstrate that people hope to benefit from programme in this area need to be well inform about their social security entitlement .
knowledge of foreign language be accept as a necessary precursor to mobility .
remember that 2001 have be designate european year of language .
it be therefore vital to promote the learning of at least two community language , to encourage linguistic and cultural preparation prior to any mobility measure .
then there be the scandalous taxis on renewal of residence permit .
these must be regard as an obstacle to be eliminate .
the report also stress the need to eliminate obstacle to mobility , be they legal , linguistic , cultural , financial or administrative .
I call on the member state to coordinate the formality to be fulfil for enrol in the establishment of other member state .
I be especially think of deadline .
to illustrate my point , I need only refer to a case bring to my attention last friday .
a young man who have pass his baccalaureat be refuse registration in belgium , because he have miss the deadline by three day !
this be just one example among many .
I shall end by mention one of my pet subject , mutual recognition of qualification .
to avoid repeat myself , I refer you to my early speech .
mobility inside the european union be one of the essential condition for enable european citizen to feel that they be full member of this europe we be gradually build .
this be more than a symbol ; it be a reason , a drive force , for belong to the european culture and model we be proclaim .
that be why I shall vote for this report .
it lay down condition to enable people travel inside the union to do so free from restriction on their right , their social security , or other benefit .
this report be all the more important because it come at a critical time for the european union , a time of enlargement .
mobility for all , include national of third country legally resident in union territory and student and teacher act independently - outside the socrate and leonardo programme - be one of the fundamental value of the union which we must uphold so that the candidate country know exactly what kind of union they will be join .
as the rapporteur say , the commission appear to be aware that , unless concrete measure be adopt , certain fundamental freedom that be enshrine in the treaty , such as the right of residence and the right of free movement , be , in practice , in danger of become mere statement of principle .
the commission must therefore adopt ambitious measure to guarantee the right to reside and settle , and , amongst other , the right to work , the right to study and the right to have one & apo ; s qualification recognise in member state other than one & apo ; s own .
- ( sv ) while in principle we adopt a positive view of the european parliament and the council & apos ; s recommendation on mobility within the community , we would like to state the follow :
we believe that , from the point of view of equality and justice , it be very important that third - country national resident within the eu should have the right to utilise the provision of community legislation on the same term as the union & apos ; s own citizen .
we also believe that , to a great extent , the member state themselves should be allow to decide on the taxis to be collect .
healthy competition will reduce the tax burden on business , encourage entrepreneurship and therefore the creation of job opportunity .
in this way , the state & apos ; loss of income due to tax competition may be offset by the fact that more people be pay income tax .
we be therefore oppose to amendment 38 concern the introduction of common tax regulation for volunteer .
I strongly endorse this report from my colleague , robert evans , design to boost mobility amongst student and other involve in training across the eu .
he be right to emphasise the need for further action to overcome bureaucratic problem relate to residence right and right to emphasise the need of disadvantaged group such as the disabled .
I support his desire to see research worker include in the proposal and his comment about the importance of involve country prepare to join the eu .
I hope when this report come back for second reading we be able to note that the council have incorporate the rapporteur & apos;s sensible amendment .
the two - fold approach of education and examination for master craftsman diploma or certificate be prerequisite to future economic success .
mobility and life - long learning must go hand in hand with assure a high standard of education for our young student and work people .
report cashman ( a5 - 0259 / 2000 )
mr president , I be prompt to vote for the cashman report by the word of the chairman of the pensioner & apo ; association of the municipality where I live - curno , in the district of bergamo , italy - who say to I , & apos ; we have absolutely no way of safeguard the interest of the elderly .
we would like to put forward proposal to prevent they be poorly treat as , sadly , frequently occur , but we do not have the money to do so . once a year , the mayor of the village invite we all to a lentil supper , similar to the lentil stew jacob give esau in the bible .
that one meal be all we get the whole year , but there be nothing practical we can do about it . & apos ;
so , roll on the financing for the action to combat age - discrimination provide for in the cashman report .
that be why I vote for the motion .
we independent welcome the action programme propose by the commission for fight discrimination .
but we vehemently reject the proposal submit by the committee on citizen & apo ; freedom and right , justice and home affair to set up another special unit for the implementation of this programme .
discrimination can not be tackle by create additional administrative body ; but solely by change people & apo ; s attitude .
communicate traditional value such as tolerance and respect for diversity can do far more to help achieve this goal than the most detailed annual report on the various form of discrimination .
report mann ( a5 - 0264 / 2000 )
mr president , on behalf of the group of the european people & apo ; s party , I would like to draw two point require clarification to your attention .
I will deal firstly with amendment no 15 .
this amendment highlight a procedure concern the acquis communautaire .
the association agreement conclude between the european union and the candidate country , and those which have yet to be conclude , should incorporate regulation ban discrimination against group protect under article 13 .
it be all the more crucial for this step to be take if certain candidate country have minority that require protection on the employment and occupation front .
secondly : amendment no 18 .
the amendment refer to the fact that many member state have provision in place that could lead to discrimination against homosexual seek employment .
however , the amendment do not emphasise the importance of criminal law provision in deal with such behaviour .
it take the form of a recommendation , in as much as it state that the member state should annul these provision .
in phrase it this way , the principle of subsidiarity be uphold .
this do not fall within europe & apos ; s sphere of competence .
I be slightly disappoint that we do not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of document .
I have propose six to twelve month . as I see it , that would be realistic in operational term .
I work for company for many year .
we be unable to achieve this .
what we do manage to achieve though , and what please I enormously , be that we be able to make it abundantly clear that special regulation must be introduce for religious community , because we must make it possible for people to identify with the idea behind and the fundamental aim of these community .
we score a major common victory there , to my mind , and we also finally manage to secure regulation benefit the physically handicapped .
I be delighted that people have be so willing to compromise today , as indeed our voting have show .
I would like to thank you all again most warmly for your excellent teamwork .
mr president , I have be a member of the european parliament for 15 month now .
today , 5 october 2000 , do not start well , but it have become the happy day of my time at parliament , for today amendment no 62 to mr thomas mann & apos;s report have be adopt .
I strongly support this amendment , which read : & quot ; no discrimination as regard access to health care , welfare benefit , and economic assistance shall be permit on the ground of the age of a disabled person & quot ; .
in my opinion , this be an extremely important result : it show - if I may be permit to rejoice at this , mr president - that there be some point to my be here .
I would like to thank the member who help and support I - for I could not have achieve this result alone - mr speroni of the lega nord , mr thomas mann , the rapporteur , from the european people & apos;s party , mrs lambert of the group of the green and mr helmer from the british conservative party .
they have rise above party politic and show that , when an amendment be right , they will support it , whoever the author .
I have not vote for the mann report because , while it be indeed necessary to seek equal treatment for people in employment and occupation , it be also necessary to refrain from push zeal to the point of abandon all protection of freedom and all respect for the rule of law .
this article have be slightly modify by an amendment from the european parliament , which complicate the wording , but do not alter the general thrust .
if this directive be adopt , it would then be up to the accuse employer to prove his innocence , not up to the accuser to provide evidence for his claim .
thus , the usual principle of the rule of law be be gradually alter under the influence of an extremist approach to combat discrimination , with the european parliament and commission only too happy to join in and poke their nose into every national law .
yet again , we can not approve of this shift , which be also go to be boost by the draft charter of fundamental right of the european union , because its present wording extend the anti - discrimination clause that the treaty of amsterdam have already introduce into european law .
during the treaty of amsterdam negotiation we be delighted with the inclusion of article 13 on discrimination on the ground of sex , racial or ethnic origin , religion or belief , disability , age and sexual orientation .
that kind of provision bear witness to the community & apos ; s commitment to promote a more just , more egalitarian society , and above all , it have open the way to appropriate community action aim at contribute to the fight against discrimination in general .
it mean the effort make by the community to promote gender equality can be complete by attack new ground for discrimination .
it give new and significant impetus to community action in an area where a certain legislative acquis and fruitful cooperation with civil society exist .
that be the basis on which measure to combat discrimination have be adopt .
the proposal consist of two draft directive , cover discrimination in employment and discrimination base on race and ethnic origin , and an action programme intend to support the effort of the member state .
as regard the parallel directive on equal treatment irrespective of race or ethnic origin , the council succeed in reach political agreement after the european parliament revise its opinion on the issue .
we have therefore have to vote on the directive on equal treatment in employment and the 2001 / 2006 action programme .
to explain my vote , I would first say that the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination be a fundamental human right .
but while this right have be recognise , it be very far from be convert into reality , hence the advantage of adopt determined and coordinated measure at european level .
as regard the mann report on equal treatment in employment , I shall limit myself to emphasise my satisfaction that the ground for derogation have be successfully reduce to the minimum .
otherwise the door would be open to abuse contrary to the aim of this directive .
certain possibility remain and I have to admit I be unhappy about they .
these be the ground for derogation in matter of religion .
the provision for derogation on religious ground on the basis of the notion of essential and direct occupational requirement carry the risk of broad interpretation .
as a confirm secularist , I can not associate myself with that .
similarly , I be concerned about the derogation authorise on the basis of age , as old people be particularly at risk of discrimination in relation to employment .
as regard the action programme to fight discrimination , the european commission & apos ; s proposal be broadly satisfactory .
there be some deplorable gap and inaccuracy which have be correct , with my support .
I feel it be essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of article 13 of the treaty .
I be also very pleased that harassment will in future be regard as a form of discrimination and that there be recognition that discrimination must be prevent , not just combat .
it be important to reaffirm the need to associate the candidate country with this programme .
everyone be well aware of the problem face by certain minority in those country .
my final comment relate to the budget for this programme , eur 98.4 million . that figure be obviously inadequate give the action envisage .
in conclusion , I support the spirit of these proposal and I have vote for most of they , the exception be where they be in contradiction with my secularism .
the proposal for a directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation before we today be a response to a demand long express by the european parliament , and our group in particular .
it be actually one of three part of a package of measure on combat discrimination base on the new article 13 , introduce by the treaty of amsterdam , and include a community action programme .
these text should , then , fill a glaring gap in the construction of europe : recognition of the real need of people exclude or marginalise in our society because of disability , age , or membership of a minority .
the text therefore represent some of the first step towards the people & apo ; s europe that we have want for so long .
so , I enthusiastically support this proposal for a directive and the very positive amendment propose by our rapporteur to improve its effectiveness .
in parallel , the amendment extend the exception to the principle of non - discrimination to the wide & apo ; social & apo ; activity of religious organisation , where the discrimination be solely base on religious conviction and on no other ground , be a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structure as compare with public or private service .
on the other hand , the amendment provide for penalty against company infringe the principle of equal treatment by exclude they from public contract seem to I both poorly adapt to the purpose and subject to divergent interpretation .
in addition , they open the door to distortion in competition between business in different european union country .
that be why I wish to express reservation on that point , while vote in favour of the text as a whole .
the snp welcome this directive and its aim to end discrimination in the workplace .
the unfair treatment of worker on the ground of race , religious belief , disability , age or sexual orientation can in no way be justify in a modern and socially just europe .
this directive give member state a great opportunity to enhance the right of worker across the european union .
the snp be pleased to support this legislation , which be in line with our party & apos;s policy of end discrimination in all its guise and of positively back measure to ensure equality of treatment for all citizen .
moreover the snp see this legislation as a means to fulfil the underlie objective of the european union in recognise that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and assist the eu & apos;s aim of permit the free movement of its citizen .
amendment no 18 : the directive under discussion concern a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and the over - generalise wording in amendment no 18 be not relevant in all aspect to this directive .
it be manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose be also to interfere in provision on age that apply in member state , which , in any case , be fully justify for reason of psychological development , and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market .
for these reason I vote against the amendment , although discrimination in employment and occupation in all its form must be oppose .
amendment no 37 : the form the committee have propose for article 4.2 of this directive be good and could ensure there be a significant degree of continuity in the wide social activity of religious organisation , which be a basis for all european socio - political thinking , and be still an important part of its activity in practice .
in addition , the wording propose by the committee reconfirm the vitality of the individual culture and custom of small , immigrant community , among other .
for these reason I vote in favour of the amendment .
our colleague , thomas mann , have invest a great deal of work in a report on the proposal for a council directive establish a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation .
his report be adopt unanimously in the committee on employment and social affair .
however , we then have 13 improvement amendment to consider , in addition to the 60 contain in the mann report on the directive propose by the commission .
there be a saying we would do well not to ignore in our effort to amend the commission proposal , which be actually well think through as a rule , and this be how it go & apo ; what be well be the enemy of what be good & apos ; .
that be only common sense in fact .
one could not help but wonder if common sense have always prevail in the drafting of certain , no doubt well - meaning , propose amendment that be now before we .
if the directive be to be adopt and implement , it must not be encumber with a literary approach and wishful thinking , which have no place in a legal document .
that be most certainly true of the amendment which propose that this directive should end the sexually discriminatory practice of stipulate that only male personnel can wear a tie .
if absurdity could kill then the author of such an amendment would definitely no long be with we .
I think it be also go too far to expect employer to provide statistic on all aspect of their employment of people fall within the scope of this directive .
the authority already have their work cut out .
this bring to mind another sound rule of thumb : & apos ; no one can achieve the impossible & apos ; .
I also think that we can do without the entire content of the new article 12 ( a ) .
the commission rightly refrain - on the basis of the subsidiarity principle , of course - from instruct the member state to set up new institution for monitor the application of the principle of equal treatment , which could be consult by every conceivable , and inconceivable , group of people or association etc , request free handling of their complaint , and which could even be grant access to confidential personnel file .
despite all the inconsistency and superfluous proposal , which do nothing to help the cause , I do not want to vote against the report at the final vote .
but here too , I feel that & apo ; less would have be more & apo ; , and the commission proposal , without the superfluous amendment , be the well and more logical instrument for ensure equal treatment in employment and occupation , which be , after all , what we want .
I warmly welcome this proposal to establish a framework to combat discrimination and ensure equal treatment in employment .
the area cover be access to employment and occupation , vocational training , promotion , employment condition and membership of certain body .
the proposal cover both direct and indirect discrimination .
harassment be also include within the definition of discrimination .
with regard to disability , the principle of equal treatment entail the identification and removal of barrier in the way of person with disability who , with reasonable accommodation , be able to perform the essential function of a job .
while the proposal continue to allow difference of treatment on the ground of age they have to be objectively justify .
the proposal also allow positive action to redress gender imbalance .
these proposal deserve the serious attention of the member state and the other community institution .
the eplp have vote for the mann report on equal treatment in discrimination because it be firmly committed to the principle of combat unjustified discrimination and be broadly supportive of the overall objective behind this proposal .
however the eplp have strong reservation about the follow area .
on disability , whilst we welcome the principle of the proposal , the uk be justly proud of our own disability discrimination legislation , but we do not want to impose our model on other member state .
however , we do want to ensure the directive let we continue with the approach in the disability discrimination act , although we recognise that some relatively minor change may be require .
on age , the eplp welcome the principle of fight age discrimination in employment and training .
this be a very complex area and the proposal be far - reach and ambitious .
however , we feel it be important that the community have legislation which be clear and workable .
on religion / belief , the eplp welcome the principle of protection on these ground .
for the uk this would end the anomaly whereby two non - major christian group ( jews , sikhs ) , receive protection both from direct and indirect discrimination under the uk race relation act as they be recognise by the court as ethnic group as well as religious group .
under some circumstance , muslim receive protection , but only in case of indirect discrimination , whilst afro - caribbean muslims , white muslims and indeed christians , receive no protection at all .
however , the uk be one of the most religiously diverse population in the european union , so it be important that the proposal be right .
the eplp be concern to ensure that the directive will permit section 60 of the uk schools standard and framework act 1998 to remain unaltered .
on sexual orientation , we welcome the principle of the commission & apos;s proposal to fight discrimination on this ground .
further concern :
much of the text will need further clarification before it be finalise .
we have concern about the unclear definition of & apos ; reasonable accommodation & apos ; and & apos ; undue hardship & apo ; in article 2 ( 4 ) , and the possible contradiction with the public procurement directive in the amendment on article 55 .
several area of difference with the race directive should be eliminate , such as the definition of indirect discrimination in amendment no 21 , the defence of right in article 8 , the text on victimisation in article 10 , and article 11 cover dissemination of information .
we also feel that the directive should be clear about which difference of treatment on the ground of age be permissible and which be not .
we have concern about several element which appear to be overburdensome : notably application of the legislation to volunteer worker in charity and to public post , and also compulsory collection and monitoring of statistic .
we be concerned about the inclusion of health , social security and assistance as there be considerable national difference in how these matter be handle and whether they form part of the employee / employer relationship .
there be also element which , we feel , should be leave to member state such as overall implementation , provision of training to particular age group of worker , the nature of a mediation system , and how sme be to interpret the directive .
finally , some element should be permissive rather than mandatory to cater for different member state practice .
we believe that the negation to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issue and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefit it will bring to worker in the uk and other eu country .
I vote against these report because they enshrine within they the principle that sex perversion be elevate onto the level of holy marriage and sex only within the marriage bond .
they also discriminate against people and organisation who believe the holy scripture to be the word of god , the only infallible rule of faith and practice , force such believer to employ those who propagate and practise act of sex totally against the scriptural ethic .
it be on this issue alone that I vote no .
broadly speak , the christian democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establish a general framework for employment equality .
however , we feel that the committee & apos ; s amendment concern statistic divide accord to target group - i.e. base on the exist reason for discrimination , such as race , ethnic origin , age , religion or belief , as well as sexual orientation - be far too great a violation of integrity .
we have therefore decide to vote against this amendment , but we support the report as such .
report van hulten ( a5 - 0260 / 2000 )
I have abstain on the van hulten report because I do not think we should increase the number of control authority within the european institution .
this & apo ; control frenzy & apos ; actually lead to official be free from responsibility , to a situation where everyone try to palm off responsibility on the controller , and the controller of the controller .
the european union suffer from a bad image among many citizen .
rapporteur van hulten express the following view in an interview with a dutch weekly magazine , & quot ; it be call europe , it be in brussels and be corrupt . & quot ;
thank to the action take by a & quot ; whistle blower & quot ; and the committee of wise man , corruption have be bring out into the open .
in the interview , mr van hulten be right in say that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solve problem such as fraud , waste , but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision - making .
the financial reform , more specifically the establishment of an internal audit department , be conducive to the european union & apos ; s effectiveness .
rapporteur van hulten be right in fill in the gap in the commission proposal : what be need be a clear definition of the distribution of responsibility between financial control and internal audit .
but if mr van hulten would like to dedicate himself to an efficient and effective union , we , along with the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on budget , can not see why he should exempt small institution , such as the committee of the region , from internal audit duty .
this view be at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation .
naturally the number of transaction in the small institution be small than in the large one - the 800 000 transaction perform annually in the commission eclipse the 10 000 transaction perform annually in the committee of the region .
but this only say something about the staffing level of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department .
this be the reason why I have apply for split voting on amendment no 3 . in this way , it will still be possible to include the obligation of an internal audit department in the proposal .
although the rapporteur share my view that all institution must be give equal treatment , he would like to postpone this equal treatment until the definitive review of the financial regulation in eighteen month & apo ; time .
in my view , if the opportunity present itself to step up efficiency within the eu institution , each day that pass while we be wait be one too many .
to set up an internal audit office in the institution will naturally require effort , but that effort will remain the same , whether it be make now or in the future .
the image of europe be not serve by the efficient operation of the large eu institution alone ; in many respect , it be probably the small one that make all the difference .
report titley ( a5 - 0211 / 2000 )
I be sure , in common with all my colleague , we support the proper management and control of arm export in the european union .
we have many example of how uncontrolled and unscrupulous arm export have exacerbate many of the conflict in the past century and even into the present time .
we , in europe , along with our colleague across the globe , have to see that the mistake and greed of the past be not repeat .
the reason of my vote on this report relate , in the main , to the question of close european union relation with nato and also the onward rush to a common defence policy .
many will speak about peace and conflict resolution while at the same time will be make deal to sell arm to combatant .
if this two - face policy be stop then many of the difficulty could be overcome .
as state at the outset , I be in favour of great control over arm export , but this issue should not be confuse with other political initiative .
even if we sympathise with the idea of regulate the european production and export of arm politically , we be sceptical about the titley report , mainly for the follow reason .
there be no link between the development of the arm industry and eu cooperation in the area of military policy .
the eu have decide to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so - call petersberg objective ( crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the eu ) , but it have no common defence policy .
the individual eu country be member of nato and the weu , or else be non - align .
policy on arm export must start from that point , and a distinction must be make between supervise an arm industry develop for political reason ( namely crisis management ) and arm export for purely commercial reason . in our view , such export ought to be keep to a minimum and , in the long term , completely abolish .
we welcome the initiative for code of conduct for arm export .
many of mr titley & apos ; s proposal and comment in the report represent improvement to the council & apos ; s original report .
nonetheless , we have decide to vote against mr titley & apos ; s report for the follow reason :
the report mean continued recognition of the importance of a strong european military capacity instead of place the emphasis on the need for disarmament and peace .
the report see arm export control primarily as a method of avoid awkward situation for europe & apos ; s military industry and not as a way of achieve disarmament and peace .
moreover , the report discuss european arm export as a way of solve future local conflict in the immediate vicinity of europe .
despite the request from the group of the green , the rapporteur have also consistently fail to discuss turkey which , through its membership of nato , be in practice exclude from the code of conduct .
the report also mean that europe & apos ; s war industry be regard as an economically important industry , and that be an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task be implicitly to kill and annihilate people .
as long as the european parliament be unable to make the logical connection between the production and sale of arm and the continue global military destruction of the environment and human life , we can not support report such as this .
support this report from my colleague , gary titley , and agree with he that responsible arm trade practice form part of the & quot ; acquis communautaire & quot ; and therefore candidate country should be actively involve in the further development of the code of conduct on arm export and that this should be legally binding .
I particularly share his view that there be a need to establish common rule and effective eu control to combat illegal arm trafficking and to control the legal trade in small arm and light weapon .
I trust the member state will give this consider and early attention .
the world would be a safe place without weapon .
I be therefore in favour of a code of conduct which render it impossible to produce and export arm and which result in arm factory switch over to the production of useful commodity .
from this perspective , I have read mr titley & apos ; s proposal and examine to what extent his text contribute to a world of peace without weapon .
in general term , I endorse the small step forward , even if they do not , by any mean , completely lead to the solution put forward by myself .
it be a different matter if such a small step forward put a spanner in the work when it come to reach real solution .
I believe that the choice today be not between complete freedom in the arm trade and this code of conduct .
if these be the two option , I would endorse the code of conduct as the less of the two evil , the underlie rationale be that something be well than nothing .
however , the real choice be between this code of conduct and a complete ban .
the code of conduct be base on the assumption that the arm trade will continue to exist and that european arm production must be promote .
the excrescence be be regulate because it be they that draw attention and instil indignation .
the issue of the arm trade itself remain out of range .
to I , this be a reason not to support the code of conduct .
- ( sv ) it be good that the european union wish to implement a code of conduct to restrict arm export .
however , I can not accept the introduction of the requirement of a common defence policy and a european security and defence policy within nato .
sweden be neutral and do not intend to enter into any defence alliance .
consequently , I can not support these viewpoint , express either in recital r or in paragraph 1 c , 1 d and 1 e .
france , germany and great britain , together with the usa , be the main arm dealer feed the planet & apos ; s conflict : in africa , where 10 state be at war , and in asia , between india and pakistan .
the european state have sell arm to indonesia , whose army be implicate in the massacre in timor and the moluccas .
france be sell helicopter to turkey , which be wage war against the kurdish people , and aircraft to china and taiwan , not to mention the scandal of the famous taiwan frigate .
in the recent past , france be an accomplice to the genocide in rwanda by deliver any amount of small arm to the regime perpetrate the massacre .
no one have yet insist that the european union and france answer for that .
the resolution be not seek to reduce arm sale radically to promote a policy of disarmament , but just to regulate they in order to guarantee great profit for the industrial group .
there be no such thing as a bloodless war .
there be only war that kill .
this hypocritical resolution seek the implementation of a & apo ; european code of conduct & apos ; while simultaneously declare that the defence industry be & apos ; economically and strategically important for the eu & apos ; .
we take the view that the restructuring of the defence industry should not be motivate by the political ambition to create a common defence policy , but by the strategic and industrial requirement of the major company and member state involve .
on this basis , link - up between european and north american company be as much to be welcome as between european company .
while we can support a code of conduct which set out a level playing field with a set of rule to which we can all voluntarily adhere , we do not wish to encumber industry with more unnecessary regulation .
in particular , we do not support the proposal , in paragraph 9 of the resolution , that the code of conduct should be make legally binding .
while there be much that we can agree with in this resolution there be a number of fundamental flaw and this be why we have abstain in our vote .
report angelilli ( a5 - 0258 / 2000 )
child be the first victim of violence on television .
we all now recognise the impact and the harm which the daily and increase bombardment of violent television programme and similar multimedia product wreak on young people , who be less discerning because their critical faculty be not fully develop .
the commission text and the report contain a number of accurate finding as regard the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and develop personality of child and , consequently , on the danger in store for tomorrow & apos ; s society as the result of their watch these programme and use these product .
however , their proposal be confine to watershed and programme classification and , in adopt the oxford university report on television programme filtering device , which parent have to buy before they can use they to protect their child , be target specifically at digital and subscriber television .
once again , the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our child , i.e. the member of tomorrow & apos ; s society , be be hijack by commercialisation and the profit motive .
the entire onus of protect child be on the parent and the question of the actual production and broadcasting of programme which be harmful to child be hardly even touch on .
and , assume that they can afford these filtering device , how be parent suppose to protect their child from so - call child & apo ; s programme , the majority of which contain scene of violence and some of which be scary than horror film ?
and how be they suppose to protect they from the violence which inundate multimedia product and the internet ?
the only reference to company be to do with a code of self - regulation .
we do agree with a number of interesting proposal on protect child in the angelilli report , such as the need for a detailed study into the moral and legal aspect of the protection of minor .
I have today vote against roberta angelilli & apos ; s report on the communication from the commission on an investigation concern parental control of television broadcasting .
if I do so , it be not because I be oppose to the report as such but because I should like to send a clear signal to the effect that the eu and the commission should concentrate on their core task .
it be not a task for the eu but for the member state to take initiative in this area .
there be enough other press task for the commission to expend its energy on .
as the father of two small child , I have take a particular interest in the result of the study on parental control of television broadcasting .
I be delighted this study have be complete .
the legal and ethical framework do indeed vary from one member state to another in line with national tradition and culture .
there be no single european definition of a minor nor be there full agreement on what be or be not harmful to minor watch certain television programme .
everyone agree , however , that it be in the public interest to make a decisive stand against the wave of violence and other content dangerous to young people which be flood television programme and audiovisual service transmit via network , in order to protect the psychological balance of minor .
minor be different from adult .
they be more vulnerable , less able to exercise critical judgement and at great risk of be disturb .
like the rapporteur , I believe measure intend to protect young people from violent and harmful programme should not be limit to traditional television but should apply to all medium .
I also think it be essential to put the emphasis on teach child medium skill .
so there be a need to strengthen national and regional awareness - raise campaign on the protection of minor in the media context , involve family and the education world .
also , television programme filtering device must be sell at price affordable to all .
at the same time , such measure obviously do not imply that the service provider should in any way be relieve of all responsibility for the content they broadcast .
give that issue link to radio and television be the responsibility of the member state , I support the request make to they that they and the commission lie down in law the responsibility incumbent on the medium company .
I also think it be essential for european union television operator to draw up a code of self - regulation for the protection of minor .
I end by congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
I welcome the main provision of this report , which highlight once again the importance that the european parliament attach to the protection of our young child in europe .
this report confirm that it be in the public interest to protect child from view excessive television violence and other programme that may produce harmful effect .
the subject of this report be both highly specific and highly complex .
any further analysis of specific technology such as filtering system will have to take account of the advance in technology which be evident today .
this report be base on the principle of common sense .
it be premise on the need for television broadcasting to take responsibility for the protection of minor by mean of a self - regulatory code which should apply throughout the european union .
a committee of expert will also be constitute at a european community level with the mandate of draw up a memorandum set out general principle for the protection of minor in the media context .
it be now incumbent on the european commission and the european parliament and all interested party to work together to see how good young people can be protect from view excessive television violence .
I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisation , both from the private and the public sector within the european union , will engage positively in this process .
certainly we must recognise that technology be change rapidly within the television sector within europe .
digitalisation of old analogue television network be take place across the length and breadth of the participate member state of the eu .
this , too , will lead to great challenge for legislator to put in place the necessary protective measure to guarantee that young child be protect from view wholly violent and inappropriate television programme .
I will be work closely at national european level to ensure that eu government implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanism which I have address .
tv be now an essential part of daily life .
with view average three hour per day , it be the most extensive human activity after sleep and - for adult - work .
change at work , like more work woman and more flexible hour , mean child be increasingly leave alone with the small screen .
there be various solution , but none be satisfactory .
a self - regulation code for professional be an excellent solution , however .
I feel that this be the right direction .
as the rapporteur have stress , parental control must not end with tv .
child be also great consumer of the internet and video game .
the approach must include all form of image transmission .
she spell out the difficulty of operate at community level , when every member state have its own history and its own special relationship with its national television . individual cultural feature be reflect in the content of programme .
I also support the amendment from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party which contribute useful detail on & apos ; who do what & apos ; .
I should like to congratulate mrs angelilli on the proposal in her report on develop control mechanism to protect child from watch violent and other broadcast which be unsuitable for their age .
under these circumstance , it be essential that all the member state comply with community legislation as quickly as possible .
furthermore , I have ascertain from a personal investigation in the relevant commission service that eight member state ( austria , belgium , denmark , finland , portugal , sweden , spain and the uk ) be apply community legislation , while the rest ( france , germany , greece , ireland , italy , the netherlands and luxembourg ) be infringe it one way or another .
I also agree with my fellow member that these measure should not be confine solely to television and should also apply to the internet , which no long have any reason to & quot ; envy & quot ; television , now that its multiple application include film projection .
if all these proposal be to be translate from theory into practice , we need to create filtering and classification mechanism which allow parent to select the programme which be suitable for their child .
encourage industry to move in this direction through international collaboration and increase parent & apo ; , teacher & apos ; and child & apos ; s awareness will act as a catalyst .
report dybkjær ( a5 - 0198 / 2000 )
this third annual report on equal opportunity for woman and man in the european union set out the highlight and success of the year 1998 .
it must be say that although equality between woman and man have be proclaim by law , the fact be there to remind we that the discrimination and difficulty woman face unfortunately persist .
woman be the most vulnerable to unemployment .
the 1998 report make a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under - employment of woman .
it also analyse the measure take to incorporate employment policy strictly focus on woman or policy to restrict gender discrimination in employment , for example , in employment contract , type of employment and remuneration .
moreover , woman be often in & apos ; flexible & apos ; job ; temporary contract and low salary be typical in sector where woman employee be in a majority .
woman & apo ; s career be often unstable , and they can only acquire experience with difficulty .
that situation be often illustrate by low level of social protection and precarious living condition .
woman be also over - represent in & apo ; typically female & apo ; occupation but under - represent in job with responsibility and in the profession .
furthermore , woman be not as well represent as man in rapidly grow sector such as information and communication technology , with woman tend to occupy the low level in the hierarchy .
it be therefore crucial to restore balance by establish education and training policy specifically gear to young woman .
gender disparity be also prevalent when it come to wage and salary . figure available for 1995 show that for the european union as a whole , the hourly wage for a woman be only 73 % of that for a man do equal work .
I therefore fully support the rapporteur in urge the commission to pursue its effort and in particular to strengthen the & apo ; strategic & apo ; nature of its annual report , by assess the effectiveness of policy initiative rather than content itself with describe they .
I also think it be necessary to stress that community standard of respect for woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity should be implement in the candidate country even before they join .
finally , I invite the member state to pursue the dual strategy advocate at community level , involve mainstreaming and specific action for woman .
interestingly , this be the first time that the need for the commission & apos ; s annual report to go far in its evaluation of the efficacy of political initiative have be identify .
what we have before we be a motion which , although not lack in proposal for study and research , stop well short of a real approach which will highlight crucial problem not yet resolve and the new problem which be begin to threaten exist right and achievement , together with their real cause .
woman be still one of the most vulnerable section of society , whose right be rudely trample underfoot by the current social and economic system .
that be what we should have acknowledge first , then we would not have have such a knee - jerk report singing praise and dispense declaration of intent .
equal opportunity at work , equal social participation , equality in health and elsewhere be impossible within a framework of reactionary policy offensive to human dignity as a whole , without equal social prospect , in a society of unemployment and underemployment , with no welfare state , a society in which human value be cost and commercialise .
social right and social achievement be not expand ; on the contrary , they be increasingly be erode on the ground that they be too expensive .
they be the first to fall foul of cut in public spending , privatisation of the health sector , the right to health care and medical attention - never mind the right to prevention and information programme .
they work in condition which be bad for their physical , mental and spiritual health , condition which affect woman more than man because they have to juggle so many duty and take on double and triple social role .
even the report acknowledge that , & quot ; in addition to their general failure to substantiate the impact of policy and programme , the report also fail to discuss the factor behind continue inequality . & quot ;
how can progress in resolve woman & apo ; s problem and offer they institutional protection against all form of discrimination be plan and strengthen within the framework of a social and economic system which commercialise and subject everything to the rigour of public financial policy and the quest for great profit ?
a policy of fundamental protection for woman can not be implement unless we redirect and radically restructure our social development model .
in the face of plan and practice to exploit and oppress , in the face of discriminatory tactic , we call on woman to enforce and claim their demand together with man within the framework of a wide grass - root battle front in each individual country .
although it have some positive point , this motion merely skirt round the problem .
we fear that its proclamation and good intention be , yet again , no more than & apo ; lame excuse & apo ; .
that conclude the vote .
( the sitting be suspend at 1.06 p.m. and resume at 3 p.m. )
topical and urgent debate
the next item be the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance .
peru
the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution :
b5 - 0777 / 2000 , by mr medina ortega and other , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the crisis in peru ;
b5 - 0780 / 2000 , by mr di pietro , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on the situation in peru ;
b5 - 0784 / 2000 , by mr salafranca sánchez - neyra , on behalf of the group of the european people & apo ; s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the crisis in peru ;
b5 - 0790 / 2000 , by mr lipietz and mr nogueira román , on behalf of the group of the green / european free alliance , on the crisis in peru ;
b5 - 0792 / 2000 , by mr marset campos and mr di lello finuoli , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leave / nordic green left , on the crisis in peru .
mr president , I have here a speech I give on 9 april 1992 , in which I refer to the coup , the so - call self - inflict coup , by president fujimori , and at the time I say that it be not acceptable for a democratically elect president to relinquish his legitimacy by rely on the armed force .
since the last electoral farce , fujimori have lose his legitimacy and not only that , but he have lose the political support that he previously have .
at the moment , the question that arise be the future of peru , of know whether the country will be able to get out of the difficult situation in which mr fujimori have now place it .
various political group have present a joint draft resolution in which we basically ask president fujimori to go , but to do so in such a way that , through a process of clean and democratic election , democracy can be consolidate in that country .
secondly , we ask the institution of the european union to help the democratic process in peru , which be something that they be capable of do .
we be also ask for a delegation from the european parliament to go to peru in order to monitor the development of event on the ground .
we hope that fujimori do not make thing bad , that he make this transition possible and that in peru there will not be the same situation as there currently be in belgrade , with a popular uprising that be practically on the street .
therefore , I think that if the european institution and the european parliament help the peruvian people at this difficult time , we could contribute to the stability of the country and to the consolidation of democratic institution across latin america .
mr president , peru be currently go through a period of uncertainty , and we all cherish the hope that the current situation will be resolve through a process in which all civil and political right be guarantee , which will help to strengthen and consolidate democracy and peace in peru , a country that have suffer 25 000 death in the last fifteen year .
also , the european union must , with maximum care , invite all the peruvian democratic force to take part in dialogue in order to achieve commitment guarantee the exercise of civil and public right and freedom of expression .
mr president , we be delighted to have confirmation of what we predict in a recent vote .
the european parliament firmly reject the election of mr fujimori and I be pleased to see honourable member in the two main group commit themselves clearly to strong european parliament support for establish democracy in peru .
but we be concerned about the fate of mr montesino .
the right of asylum can not be use to protect criminal .
the whole world rejoice when the international resolution finally begin to work against one former dictator , mr pinochet .
mr montesino can not be allow to find refuge in panama or , as some rumour be begin to suggest , in morocco .
he should be bring to trial on the ground of torture , drug - trafficking and the rest by any state where he seek refuge .
mr president , the peruvian people & apo ; s desire for peace , democracy , justice and well - being be come close to be realise with the resignation of mr fujimori .
the adverse effect that north american backing for he have have on those desire must be neutralise by another influence , a positive influence in favour of human right and full democratic progress , come from the european union .
for this reason , we feel it be necessary to highlight two aspect of the joint resolution that we be present .
the first aspect be that the european union should deny asylum - and not negotiate with other country either - to a figure such as montesino , who be responsible for terrible crime against humanity .
the second be that a delegation should be send from the european parliament to peru with the purpose of assess the prospect for democratic progress and for peacefully overcome the present problem , so that our contribution will be a very positive one .
mr president , I would prefer it if , for once , we could have a debate on latin america follow well - prepare discussion in the committee , rather than it be part of some urgent procedure or other .
it seem to I that we only ever deal with event in latin america on a case by case basis , but otherwise pursue a very reticent policy .
it be a shame , because the continent merit more attention .
as far as peru be concern , a number of speaker , and also our resolution , have point to the fact that president fujimori & apos ; s forthcoming resignation offer scope for a fresh start .
I be not so sure whether this will be the case though , because there have already be one or two disturb development on this front , and I will only be convince once fujimori have actually step down or be vote out of office .
I therefore think it be extremely important for the european union to get fully involve with this country , and with the situation in peru , for example by maintain an orderly dialogue with the force of opposition .
I would like we to send the delegation that we want to send to the election - which then fail to take place for reason we be all familiar with - to peru now , with a view to support those who be work towards democratic reform in the country .
and if that be to be the outcome of this afternoon & apos ; s sit , I would be more than satisfied .
mr president , commissioner , I believe that the event in peru be evidence of the world of difference that there can be between the formal meaning of word and their tangible weight .
the term in question be the word & apo ; democracy & apos ; .
peru have a parliament which have be elect by universal suffrage and a president who have use the power of persuasion of the army to violate all constitutional precept .
I feel that this resolution mark a key point in parliament & apos;s political initiative .
I would like to focus briefly on one of the subject cover by the report : the call for parliament to send a delegation .
the european union have get to do something and do it quickly .
the process of democracy need to be consolidate , but consolidate with political instrument and human resource .
we must ensure that , when peru reach its goal , it have candidate who be capable of rise to the challenge and respond to the peruvian people & apos;s demand for political renewal and genuine democracy .
mr president , commissioner , this be why I strongly support the call for parliament to send a delegation , not just to act as a witness should something go badly wrong , but , for once in its history , to support a country which be seek a democratic way forward .
mr president , the need for the resolution on the situation in peru have make two thing clear .
the first be our frustration at have to return to the vigilance over democracy and human right in latin america , which be of major concern to parliament in the 1980 and which diminish in the 1990 with the emergence of democratic government in most country there .
it be also frustrating because , in addition to the situation in peru , other attempt at aggressive populism be create appalling dictatorship , which confirm our bad fear and mean that we must target latin america once again in our vigilance over democracy .
let we be quite frank : this resolution highlight the feeling that europe & apos ; s influence on that sub - continent have weaken .
europe feel that its conscience no long require it to intervene after the switch to democracy in the 1990 and do little for those country , apart from give advice on model of economic integration .
open up our market be symbolic - with the exception of beef from argentina , because of bse as we know - but there be very little technology transfer , cultural and political relation exist in name only , and career training and investment in add value make little progress .
europe do not take the opportunity provide by the fledgling democracy to promote development and social justice in latin america to help these country to break their almost exclusive dependence on accumulate capital , which be base on drug trafficking .
the situation with peru and mr fujimori have not yet degenerate into a disaster , mr president . there be sign of disillusionment and the situation should serve , for the moment , as a warning .
in order to avert a disaster , it be absolutely crucial that europe take its politic to the american sub - continent as well .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the condition under which election be hold in peru in may this year , be unacceptable .
against this background , the commission give its support to the organisation of american states , whose brief be to monitor a range of significant democratic reform that the government and opposition have agree on .
the european union emphasise only very recently , in a declaration , that president fujimori have seize the initiative with his decision to call fresh election .
this initiative could prove to be an important step in the direction of democracy , but only if he refrain from employ the tactic that he have announce he be go to use in these election .
if this opportunity be to be make use of , a whole range of serious shortcoming be go to have to be overcome .
these be shortcoming that become apparent during the previous election .
if these weakness be not deal with , there be a risk that the next election will be extremely dubious too .
the commission therefore support the organisation of american state in the continuation of its work as per the schedule agree at the time , and this notwithstanding the difficult condition and numerous imponderable that weigh heavily on these forthcoming new election .
the commission , in tandem with the member state , be currently examine how we can well help , in practical term , in the preparation of these plural and democratic election , and , if need be , as observer of the process .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
afghanistan
the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution :
b5 - 0776 / 2000 , by mr van den berg and mr sakellariou , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the situation in afghanistan ;
b5 - 0778 / 2000 , by mr dupuis and other , on behalf of the technical group of independent member , on the situation in afghanistan ;
b5 - 0781 / 2000 , by mrs dybkjær and mrs malmström , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on the situation in afghanistan ;
b5 - 0785 / 2000 , by mr morillon , on behalf of the group of the european people & apo ; s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the situation in afghanistan ;
b5 - 0789 / 2000 , by mrs schroedter and other , on behalf of the group of the green / european free alliance , on the situation in afghanistan ;
b5 - 0793 / 2000 , by mrs ainardi and other , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leave / nordic green left , on the position of woman in afghanistan .
mr president , I think we owe a great deal to the man behind this resolution , general morillon .
it be an important resolution because afghanistan and its desperately suffer people , and especially its child who be blow up by mine and its woman who face appalling discrimination , deserve far more attention from we .
thank to this motion for a resolution , which have find broad consensus , parliament be take a firm position .
as the resolution state , the fundamental political challenge be to put pressure on afghanistan & apos ; s large neighbour , pakistan , as a means of try to influence the situation in afghanistan , I would also add the other large neighbour , the people & apo ; s republic of china , with which pakistan have excellent relation and collaborate at military and nuclear level .
we also know that there be extensive cooperation between those two big country , pakistan and the people & apo ; s republic of china , at the level of the political nomenklatura and the local mafia as regard drug trafficking .
we know afghanistan be not far away , and we know it be the world & apos ; s large producer of opiate , so we can well imagine the role play by these political mafia , which be not necessarily simply political , in the expansion of the drug trade .
we also know that the policy of the united nations , especially that of undcp and mr arlacchi , be a disaster . despite the million of dollar invest in afghanistan in the course of the last few year , production have double .
to summarise , I think pressure need to be exert on pakistan and the people & apo ; s republic of china , all funding need to be withdraw from mr arlacchi and undcp so that these prohibitionist policy on drug do not end up encourage production and trade in drug , because that be what be happen now .
mr president , early in the day we have a debate about the right of woman in the european union , and we also touch upon the question of the new candidate country .
in face a decision like this about the taliban regime , it have to be say that it have really be a luxury , purely and simply , to discuss the other issue , when one consider what be happen in afghanistan .
ever since I first hear about the taliban regime , I have be appal .
I find it completely incredible that such thing can still be go on in the year 2000 , and not only do we not intervene , but we can not , in reality , do a vast amount about they .
in war , there will clearly always be a large number of innocent people who suffer distress or die , and very often it be , of course & apo ; woman and child and old people who be totally defenceless in a wide range of situation .
what be happen here , however , be in fact even bad .
it be a far more systematic form of oppression than be to be see in normal war situation .
it be far more systematic and far more violent in relation to a particular group of woman .
it appear as if it be simply a question of group of man who find themselves in a world in which nothing else count but their own solidarity and their own oppression of woman .
I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit point about the position of woman in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it be for we to try to help prevent the taliban regime from continue with its wholesale discrimination against woman .
be afghanistan condemn to sink back into the dark age and suffocate slowly under the taliban yoke , in the image of its woman under the weight of the obligatory chador ?
how many more death and displace person do there have to be to pierce the veil of our political indifference ?
how many more ton of drug inject into the vein of young people worldwide must we deplore ?
must we wait until state terrorism be fully establish , wait for the victory of jihad , the application of the expansionist will of religious fanatic to the whole region , before we member of the european union finally agree to get involve , as be our duty ?
the long offensive carry on by the taliban , with quite open support from pakistan , be now cut off the people of the northern alliance from a supply route essential to their survival .
the international community can no long content itself with bury its head in the sand , and conducting & apo ; wait - and - see & apo ; diplomacy .
I think I speak for many people here when I declare our rejection of a comfortable neutrality , make a theory out of passivity and justify blindness .
we protest at the sort of neutrality that tend to put the protagonist on the same level , stack the daily atrocity of the taliban regime on the same shelf as the armed resistance of commander massoud .
massoud be see as a war leader , but how could it be otherwise after so many battle ?
but for those who know he and have see he at work , he be also a man of dialogue and unification .
he see himself as the champion of a tolerant islam .
he can be a man of peace .
massoud insist that there be no military solution to the afghan problem .
he be right . we must act urgently to find political solution which respect the value underpin our union .
that be the thrust of the resolution draft by all the group , which I have the honour of defend here .
essentially it call on the council presidency to bring its influence to bear to put an end to foreign interference in that country .
it call on the commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measure intend for the afghan population so that this aid reach everyone .
finally it insist , and this be the essential point , that the european union coordinate its initiative with those of neighbouring country to impose a solution whereby peace , stability , and respect for international law and the most elementary human right can be re - establish .
we be well aware that this will not be an easy task , but here I would like to quote the motto of a great european , william of orange : & quot ; hope be not necessary to engagement , nor success to perseverance . & quot ;
mr president , afghanistan have the bad human right record in the world , both in term of the number and the severity of the violation commit .
the predicament of afghan woman be a particularly apt case in point .
woman can not go to work , girl can not go to school , woman can not walk freely down the street , and they be stone , to name but a few example .
there be not a single human right organisation work in afghanistan .
it be the country that have the most mine .
it be a country where there be no hope for the child .
75 % of the boy and 90 % of the girl do not go to school .
it be one of the poor country and there be a forget war go on .
I feel this all go to show just how important this resolution be .
on balance , it be clear that the international organisation and the un be not do enough as matter stand .
in other word , the conflict be far more complex , there be no solution in the offing and yet , as we all agree , there be an urgent need for one .
the eu have an important task before it in this respect .
it could bring its idea on non - military conflict management to bear .
there be a few example I could mention : the monitoring of weapon export and small arm through to the end - user , so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there , support for non - governmental organisation and woman & apo ; s organisation base there , which be courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation .
in particular , in light of the above , it be absolutely imperative that the member state grant asylum to all those who flee afghanistan , as a matter of course .
it would do the eu & apos ; s image no harm at all if it be to get a political initiative off the ground in the united nations , with a view to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in afghanistan .
mr president , the recent taliban offensive must obviously concern we .
terrible suffering have be cause by this conflict .
I , too , support the joint resolution , of course .
but I want to join previous speaker in emphasise two concern .
the first issue be the position of woman .
it be not something we can get use to it .
we must never trivialise it .
they still endure appalling condition : they be deny access to work , health care and education .
they live in destitution and permanent insecurity .
they be regularly victim of stoning .
they be suppress in the true sense of the word .
all afghan woman , whatever their age , be face with systematic violation of their most fundamental right .
that be why I also believe they should be entitle to the right of asylum .
the european union must renew its solidarity with all afghan woman in their struggle at home and abroad against the taliban regime .
the second issue be that the taliban be clearly seek international recognition , on the ground that they now control virtually all of afghanistan .
so peace , stability and respect for right can only be re - establish through a political solution .
great involvement of the european union be definitely need .
and in that search , I believe it be vital for the council to reinforce the restriction it have decide on .
there can be no recognition by any member state , as long as afghanistan maintain its policy of violation of human right , notably its systematic discrimination against woman .
the commission should also take much strong emergency humanitarian measure for the people , do everything possible to enable the ngo to provide aid to afghan woman and involve they in their activity .
mr president , today , just as and even more so than in the past , the tragic military success of the taliban have mean that hundred of thousand of woman be subject to severe repression and be deny medical assistance , education , the possibility of support themselves and the freedom of movement .
around a million people , most of they child , have be mutilate by anti - personnel mine .
the urgent resolution to be put to the vote today call for the concern voice by parliament on many occasion to be translate into further practical initiative .
there be one point which I must stress in particular .
there have be a budget head for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programme for many year now .
funding have be allocate for 2000 and will be provide for 2001 as well .
we need to take immediate action to prevent thousand of child inadvertently trigger tragic explosion while they be play in the field , and receive disable wound .
we can do this . the operation have be endorse and be viable , but the funding be be hold up by bureaucracy , by the need to assess previous action and by confusion over the responsibility of the different department .
lady and gentleman of the commission , look up from your text , find out what be go on outside the realm of document : thousand of child be in danger .
rise above sluggishness and uncertainty .
yes , carry out all the assessment you want to , but , in the meantime , let the fund for 2000 reach their destination and you will be save the life and prevent the mutilation of a great many unfortunate people .
mr president , maybe it be not useful or politically correct to point out who support the taliban at the start , when they be aim to achieve the power that they now have in afghanistan .
and we do need to take this into account in the european institution , as well as the fact that drug cultivation be use to buy arm .
this morning - and I will shortly conclude , mr president - a code of conduct be approve on the sale and trafficking of arm .
I do not think that this code will be useful unless it be effective in prevent weapon from reach the hand of people who be commit very serious violation against human right , as these people be .
mr president , we all know by now that we should not entertain any illusion with regard to the nature of the present regime in kabul .
we only have to cast our mind back to the event in afghanistan this summer .
the taliban launch a new military attack on their northern opponent in the middle of the bad drought this poor country have have since time immemorial .
this drought have result in a drop in harvest by an estimate 2.3 million tonne of food .
this essentially render a quarter of the total afghan population dependent on grain supply from the world food programme .
it be in just such a tragic situation that the country & apos ; s radical islamic ruler revolt against the un & apos ; s so - call bread programme in the capital of kabul .
this be a project that be due to benefit 28 000 war widow , no less .
the taliban & apos ; s excuse ?
there be countless bakery which offer employment to woman .
despite this - at least in western eye - inhumane policy , the taliban be seek international diplomatic recognition .
they seize on cooperation in the return of million of afghan refugee , sponsor by the united nations , as official global acceptance of their unbearable tyranny .
it remain very much to be see whether this religious barbarism be really sufficient for we to form a closed international containment front against the host of jihad conspirator , osama bin laden .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the current intensification in the armed conflict between the taliban and the northern alliance be extremely disturbing .
increase number of people be flee from the fighting .
some source put the number of displace people at 90 000 .
many of these be now seek sanctuary in makeshift camp in the mountain in the north - east of the country .
the condition there could go badly downhill when winter set in .
in the light of this development , echo , the commission agency for humanitarian aid , be currently work hard to put together a package of emergency aid to the value of eur 3 million , in order to support these displace people with medical supply , food , and the mean to get through the winter .
in addition , echo have already make eur 5.7 million available this year for the victim of drought in afghanistan , for mine clearance in the north of the country and for the resettlement of refugee .
the victim of drought be also due to receive a further eur 3 million .
I would like to take the opportunity to say , in response to mrs paciotti & apos ; s comment , that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the commission today as to what have become of the funding for mine clearance and what be go to become of it .
should I find that there be bureaucratic stumble block here , as you put it , then you have my word that I will do all I can to overcome these obstacle with all speed .
the honourable member be well aware that the commission have a long - term commitment to the afghan refugee and those who have be displace within afghanistan itself .
between 1991 and 2000 , the commission make a total of eur 400 million available for refugee aid , humanitarian emergency aid and food aid .
a significant slice of this be earmark for mine clearance and associate information campaign conduct by un agency , european or afghan non - governmental organisation .
with its common position on afghanistan , the european union be support the united nations & apos ; special mission in afghanistan , and the effort to achieve peace undertake by the general secretary & apos ; s special representative .
the union have resolve to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the country , and it be as plain as day that this will not come about until human right and fundamental value be give full recognition .
accordingly , the common position roundly condemn the ongoing discrimination against woman in afghanistan and other human right violation that take place there .
as long as the taliban leadership continue to be as ambiguous in its statement on opium cultivation as it have be hitherto , the commission refuse to support any anti - drugs project in afghanistan .
that say , it will give staunch support to the neighbouring country , so as to improve their chance of tackle the drug problem .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
human right
the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution :
b5 - 0794 / 2000 , by mr medina ortega , mr linkohr and mr fava , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the kidnap in colombia of a spanish jesuit engage in negotiation with the guerilla ;
b5 - 0795 / 2000 , by mr di piandro , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on the kidnap of father alejandroi matos castro in colombia ;
b5 - 0796 / 2000 , by mr marset campos , mr miranda and mr di lello finuoli , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leave / nordic green left , on kidnap , abduction , and the peace process in colombia ;
b5 - 0797 / 2000 , by mr salafranca sánchez - neyra , on behalf of the group of the european people & apo ; s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the kidnap in colombia of a spanish jesuit engage in negotiation with the guerilla .
mr president , I be speak to confirm the agreement of the various political group that have table a motion for a resolution on the kidnapping of a spanish jesuit in colombia and to inform the house that we have decide to withdraw it in view of the fact that the person have be free .
two other community citizen have also be free today .
therefore , I be not go to discuss the draft resolution , as it no long exist .
nevertheless , colombia be clearly a country that deserve our attention .
but as mr linkohr be say , the problem with latin america be that we only concern ourselves with these country when there be problem .
I think this be a good time to highlight the need for the european union to draw up a comprehensive policy on latin america which could perhaps prevent these country from regularly go through the crisis situation that some of they have experience .
mr president , I would like to reaffirm what my colleague , manuel medina , have just say .
fortunately , in this particular case , we can welcome the fact that the spanish jesuit and other spaniard , as well as other community citizen , have be release .
it be also true , however , that colombia , which we frequently discuss here , have several problem .
at the moment , for example , there be a colombian priest , oliveiro medina , who be in brazil .
his extradition to colombia could put his life in danger because we have already see , in the last resolution on colombia that we discuss , that more than 24 human right defender have recently be murder there .
unfortunately , we all hope that we would not have to discuss colombia again .
unfortunately , we may have to discuss it again , but I think that the european union should have a fundamental role - as manolo medina be say - in latin america in general .
and reduce budget for latin america be not go to help we to play the role that we should be play there .
mr president , I would like to share in the happiness of my compatriot and fellow member who have talk of their satisfaction at the freeing of the spanish jesuit alejandro mato and of other community citizen .
I therefore think that we should reiterate our support for a peaceful solution to the colombian conflict , in which the action of the drug cartel have a dramatic influence .
the european union must therefore support the initiative by president andrés pastrana , aim at achieve a negotiate peace between his government and the guerrilla group , the far ( revolutionary armed force ) and the so - call national liberation army .
mr president , the issue of colombia be something that really have not be properly address in the european union .
even the red cross be leave there because neither the paramilitary nor guerrilla respect international humanitarian law .
this highlight that the wrong approach have be take in relation to colombia .
sign peace agreement be all very well , but first and foremost we have to have respect for humanitarian law .
that be not happen there .
not so very long ago there be a resolution on the situation of the peace community in san josé de apartado .
that be less than a month ago .
since then the situation have get even bad for the community there .
at the very least five people have be kill .
we have to address the role that the paramilitary be play and also the role that the state be play in this .
it really be not acceptable that people be be persecute out of their home , out of their land and that the world be stand idly by and let this happen .
the state involvement have to be address as well .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the commission , in common with parliament , welcome the release of the spanish jesuit priest , alejandro matos castro , last week .
we call upon the guerilla group to release the other hostage .
we urge they to eschew kidnapping in future and to respect international humanitarian law .
the commission be deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in colombia , particularly in respect of the massacre perpetrate recently by paramilitary force in the so - call peaceful community of san josé de apartado .
we urge the colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstance of these crime .
the commission deplore the ongoing human - right violation in colombia and entreat the war party to continue the peace talk and work towards a last peace in colombia , base on a negotiate solution .
in this context , I would emphasise that the commission support president pastrana & apos ; s effort to secure peace and will do everything in its power to promote last peace in colombia .
in particular , the commission would like to have some say in the process when the european union put together an aid package in support of the colombian peace process .
the commission have already offer to coordinate the measure for a package of this kind , and be plan to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package as early as in the next few day .
furthermore , the commission have propose organising in brussels a follow - up meeting to the donor conference that take place on 7 july in madrid .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
as several speaker have indicate , I can inform you that after good news from colombia about the release of the jesuit priest , and follow agreement between the political group , the motion for resolution on this issue be withdraw .
former yugoslav republic of macedonia
the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution :
b5 - 0779 / 2000 , by mr dupuis and other , on behalf of the technical group of independent member , on macedonia ;
b5 - 0782 / 2000 , by mr haarbyr , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on macedonia : law on high education and university ;
b5 - 0786 / 2000 , by mrs pack and other , on behalf of the group of the european people & apo ; s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on fyrom : law on high education and university ;
b5 - 0788 / 2000 , by mr lagendijk and other , on behalf of the group of the green / european free alliance , law on high education and university in macedonia .
mr president , I just want to point out that fyrom be rather an anachronism and I invite our greek colleague , who always do their duty when macedonia be on the agenda , to intervene perhaps a little more firmly with their government and supersede this situation , which frankly border on the ridiculous .
commissioner , lady and gentleman , I think this resolution be important because it refer to a positive decision by the macedonian government , and unfortunately not by all the political force of macedonia , on the law on high education which will at last allow young people from minority , in particular the albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue .
I think we should congratulate mr georgievsky , the prime minister , and mr xhaferi , leader of the albanian party in the government majority , who be behind this law on high education . unfortunately , it be not support by the parliamentary opposition .
so , once again , we have double standard and I think that be deplorable .
I call on the commission to monitor this issue very closely .
it will take a great deal of money to establish the university .
this be a practical way of support a project which could help overcome the problem of two large , differ population live side by side , and this be an area where monitoring by the commission be crucial .
mr president , I would like to take up what mr dupuis have to say .
I believe that when the audience in the stand see arym up there , they will actually think this refer to a different country .
arym mean ancienne république yougoslave de macédoine , i.e the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
quite simply , that mean & apos ; macedonia & apos ; .
the dispute about the name be a dispute between greece and the country of macedonia .
of course we all hope - and that include the greek mep here - that this dispute will soon be settle .
we have see how the difficult situation in macedonia have steadily worsen where the treatment of the albanians be concern .
all of those who , for a long time now , have be go in and out of this country , have keep up the pressure for this problem to be resolve .
however , I would also stress that this problem be nothing new : it be the legacy of the yugoslav period , when the albanians be always discriminate against , include those in macedonia .
unfortunately , it be , of course , the case that the problem be not resolve under the last government , in the run - up to 1998 .
therefore , we be all delighted that a genuinely sound solution be perhaps at last to be find to this problem of high education .
the illegal foundation of tetovo university many year ago produce great tension in macedonia , which I be sorry to say , could not be defuse over the past few year .
we owe a duty of care to the student to ensure that this problem be resolve . after all , these student have , or have , diploma that serve no purpose in the outside world .
therefore , I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem , and have now pave the way to this end .
as a delegation , we have always insist that a solution should be find to this problem .
now at last we have find it .
not we , but the government under prime minister georgievski , and also the albanian leader , xhaferi , and above all , the representative of the council of europe , max van der stoel .
this outstanding cooperation have lead to a draft bill , which be adopt by the majority in parliament .
in common with olivi dupuis , I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition party - which form part of the government up until 1998 and could have resolve the problem - have close their mind to this draft bill without offer a well solution themselves .
I be particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the albanian opposition party , which have deliberately close its mind to the necessary solution to the albanian problem in macedonia .
the fact that the socialist opposition refuse to support this must have be against their well judgement , but that sometimes happen with the opposition , and not just in macedonia .
we be now await the necessary aid for the transformation of tetovo university into a private university whose diploma will then be recognise .
all those who want to see an improvement in the inter - ethnic relation in macedonia , in the interest of stabilisation , must now do their bit to help solve this problem and ensure that a private university actually become a reality .
that be what this urgent procedure be all about today .
people from different ethnic background must be able to live together in macedonia .
this could provide a good role model for the neighbouring country and help to stabilise the entire region .
mr president , it make a nice change in this parliament to be able to reflect on positive development in south - eastern europe , and very often the subject be macedonia where , despite all the problem this country have to deal with , the two large group of the population co - exist in peace , even form a coalition government and have now adopt a new act on high education .
that be a breakthrough on an issue which have cause a great deal of problem for a long time .
at long last , the albanians now have the opportunity to attend university course in their own language and within the official education system of macedonia .
that be a real step forward for macedonia .
as far as I be concern , it prove to all neighbouring country that education do not only have to spread hatred , as be often the case these day , but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful , multi - ethnic society .
that be a development which , in my view , deserve unqualified support from the european union .
finally , I would like to spend a moment on something which , normally speak , I do not think belong in a european parliament , namely the role of a fellow countryman .
I be proud of the fact , that this time round , the role of mr max van der stoel , the high representative for minority of the osce , have prove crucial in this issue .
mr president , I would like to echo mr lagendijk & apos ; s praise of mr van der stoel .
I believe it be extremely important for the outside world to send positive vibe to macedonia .
that do not mean to say that the macedonian people be not sufficiently alert themselves to be able to deliver something in this area .
the former president , mr gligorov , be already a shine example of non - ethnic thinking , and the new president , too , have gain the trust of all group of the population in macedonia .
in my view , it be an extraordinary achievement on the part of the macedonian to be able to settle the issue within their own border .
it appear to I that cooperation between slavonic macedonian and especially albanian - speak macedonian be an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in tetovo .
this initiative have be on the card for year and still there be no talk of official recognition .
fortunately , this initiative be now be back by a parliamentary majority , as a result of which a key problem in the inter - ethnic relation have be solve , not only because it be so important to teach in albanian at the university , but especially because it considerably enhance the social position of the albanian - speak macedonian .
it attract a new class of student to high education .
it be also significant in term of the presence of albanian speaker in the official apparatus , a presence which be currently lag far behind what should actually be the case .
it appear to I that the recognition of degree from tetovo university be a major step forward .
in time , the university should also be fund by taxpayer & apo ; money only . after all , the albanian speaker pay taxis and be just as entitle to a share when it come to pay for education .
I , myself , be educate at a university which be a & apos ; free university & apos ; , free from church and state influence , yet government - fund .
I have to say that I still believe this to be a great bonus and it also prove that the state respect the country & apos ; s own particular educational sphere .
the outside world should do all it can to help the albanian speaker integrate in their country .
mr president , lady and gentleman , my group propose to support the present motion , which we have also sign , because I believe it be right for the european union to support the solution that have be find in macedonia and which accommodate the albanian population .
I would have prefer it if we could have find a solution that all the party in parliament could have vote for .
we would rather leave it to the macedonian to discuss where the process break down , mrs pack .
I have it on good authority that they be only trivial issue , and that the government could have accommodate the opposition in this respect .
I do not know .
I do not think that be the be - all and end - all .
what matter most be that a solution be find which we can all subscribe to .
that be an important aspect we should not lose sight of .
mr president , general de gaulle speak of the & quot ; paix des brave & quot ; i.e. the peace of the brave , in the era of franco - german reconciliation , by which he mean that patriot on both side have be able to achieve a last settlement .
that be exactly what have happen in macedonia .
therefore , I also believe that this reconciliation be sustainable , but that the government , which have very courageously find a solution to the university issue and to many other issue , need visible sign of its success , and powerful support , else peace throughout the region will be under threat .
that be why it be so important , firstly , to find a solution to the name problem .
when greece , of all country , again put forward a proposal to call it slavo - macedonia , it really be ask for trouble , because that be precisely what the albanians would regard as be another example of exclusion tactic .
I be sure this would defuse no small number of problem in macedonia , too .
I feel macedonia have every chance of become a type of switzerland of the south - east , and we should give it massive support on this journey , and reject anything that could lead to a relapse into nationalism and chauvinism , which , I be sorry to say , certain force in the country be currently try to provoke for tactical reason .
without doubt , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia be help enormously to promote peace and security in the region and we trust that the last problem in its relation with greece will shortly be resolve in a way which respect the dignity of both country .
I welcome with the utmost satisfaction the new law on high education , which will create the condition need for the albanian - speak community to set up a private university .
I be convinced that this tiny country in the balkan deserve the undivided support of the european union and I trust that an association and stability agreement will be sign before the end of the french presidency .
that be why the commission have repeatedly urge the macedonian government to resolve the outstanding problem of high education in the albanian language .
the commission welcome the passing of the new law .
the commission be work with the osce high commissioner for national minority , max van der stoel , with a view to provide financial support for the implementation of this important law .
perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the commission and the high commissioner , mr van der stoel , have already get off to a good start .
our combine effort have enable we to solve a similar problem that exist in two other european country , i.e. estonia and latvia , and I be grateful to be able to take this opportunity to say that our cooperation with the osce high commissioner in this respect have be extremely constructive and valuable .
I believe the same will apply to macedonia .
the commission be intend to make eur 1 million available for the current year , under the national programme for macedonia , in order to support the implementation of this law .
the funding allocation be provide for in the financing proposal which be to be put forward today - possibly this very hour - to the phare administration committee .
if the member state adopt this financing proposal , a financing agreement will be conclude with the government and a detailed project will be draw up in close cooperation with mr van der stoel in the come week .
the phare funding make available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be use to support the university in the come academic year , i.e. in 2001 and 2002 .
thank you , commissioner .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place at 6.00 p.m .
samina ferry disaster in greece
the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution :
b5 - 0783 / 2000 , by mr katiforis and other , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the sinking of the greek ferry ;
b5 - 0787 / 2000 , by mr hatzidakis and mr trakatellis , on behalf of the group of the european people & apo ; s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the sinking of the vessel & apos ; express samina & apos ; ;
b5 - 0791 / 2000 , by mr korakas and other , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leave / nordic green left , on the sinking of the vessel & apos ; express samina & apos ; .
we be not debate here merely in order to express our sorrow ; the main subject of our debate be what happen , why it happen and how we can rectify the situation , how the commission and the european parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same do not happen again in the future .
there can be no doubt that the human factor play a decisive part .
however , there be aspect of the accident which , in my view , prove that community law have be infringe .
the directive on the registration of passenger be infringe .
the minister have admit as much , the prime minister admit as much yesterday in parliament and I hope that the socialist group in the european parliament will admit as much .
the directive on life - save equipment , life - jacket and life - raft be infringe .
mr president , on sunday , three hour before the deadline for apply directive 98 / 18 expire , some 50 greek ship be take out of service by the ministry of merchant marine .
what amaze I be that the government and the company both insist that the express samina comply with all the safety requirement .
in other word , have it not sink , it would still be sail .
the government itself say so .
so what be we call for ? we be call mainly for three thing .
firstly , full application of directive 98 / 41 on the registration of passenger . secondly , a short timetable for directive 98 / 18 so that there be no long any derogation for member state , as have be the case to date with greece .
parliament consent at second reading under pressure from the greek government at the time .
mr stenmark remember and can testify to this . and , of course , we be call for an end to the derogation for greece on cabotage , the monopoly and oligopoly arrangement govern transport by sea .
greek cabotage operator be run their new ship on the route to italy , where there be competition , and their old ship on the greek route , where there be no competition , and that be how safety standard drop .
I should like to point out that all the greek mep have now react against this situation .
we do not consider that everything be a mess in greece ; there be some very good ship and the overwhelming majority of greek seaman be very good at their job .
we have table the motion as an expression of our awareness of the issue and our intention to fight for greece to adopt even high safety standard than the european union in order to correct this negative impression of our country .
three amendment have be propose by the gue / ngl group , one on shipping register , one on work condition and one on an in situ investigation by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .
we disagree mainly on technical ground , which I do not have time to go into now , but would be happy to explain privately to my fellow member .
the problem be technical rather than political : for example , as far as shipping register be concern , the resolution already contain a reference to they and there be no need to repeat it .
mr president , lady and gentleman , we vote against a resolution on the sinking of the express samina under the urgent procedure the other day because a judicial inquiry be already under way in greece and the greek government have already make a number of statement on what need to be do .
we feel that the word of the european parliament need weight if it be to be more than pass comment .
besides , our parliament do the same every time a sad incident such as this happen . must it continue to do so ?
someone say in the house the other day that we do not want to debate shipping safety .
but have there ever be or will there ever be an in - depth debate in 2 or 3 minute under the urgent procedure ?
in deference to the house & apos ; s decision the other day , we sit round the table and thrash out a joint text which , I admit , be only make possible by the cooperation and good faith of all the group .
but , surely , this be precisely what our proactive committee on regional policy , transport and tourism be do and - as we all know - it need serious and often time - consume dialogue and procedure in order to decide what need to be do on each occasion .
be it that easy to decide what need to be do about ship under an urgent procedure ?
nor be the need for urgent procedure justify after the event , give that the compromise text contain no reference which might have be misunderstood as urgent party politic against the greek government , precisely as the result of the good faith which , as I have say , be demonstrate on all side .
so the question remain . what have we gain from the text which would have be lose have the resolution not be urgent ?
be that as it may , mr president , we have agree to this joint proposal for a resolution , which we support as it stand , urgently , and we of course disagree with the amendment table , again urgently , for the reason which I have state .
and as far as shipping be concern , in deference to the memory of the innocent victim of the express samina , we shall support and take the lead in any action which target personal safety and environmental protection and try to do more than just make an impression .
I do not know if it will be under the urgent procedure but , in essence , it must be as quickly as possible . and they do not only concern greece .
of course , we also need to reorganise and refine administrative monitoring , control and sanctioning procedure .
mr papoutsis have already & quot ; dismantled & quot ; a very important directorate in his ministry , the directorate of merchant ship survey .
it be only a very small first step , I know , and other step be need .
and because all this concern greece , which have the big shipping sector in the european union , it basically concern the safety of all type of shipping throughout the union .
mr president , I too shall , of course , start by express my deep sorrow and solidarity with the family of the victim and with those who survive along with the memory of their terrifying ordeal .
of course , accident at sea happen , human error be make ; but what be most important , mr president , be for we to see , when a human error be make , if the right action be take before and after the error .
in other word , in the present case , if the right inspection be carry out and the right certificate issue for the ship , if the life - jacket be in the right place , if the crew be do its job .
there be a whole series of thing which need look at right away , especially if community legislation be also infringe .
in my view , the greek competition committee have never act in case in which it should have act .
and , as we know , monopoly , be they private or state monopoly , be a bad thing . in the present case they be bad for both freight and passenger shipping .
it seem to I that the factor which need to be quantify here as the result of this tragic incident , be what need to be do at european union level , because the big picture be the safety of shipping in the european union .
I should like to say , as far as the resolution be concern , because there be a number of amendment , that my amendment on shipping register be cover in the text , it be already there .
as far as my amendment on working condition be concern , there be a directive on this and the wording of the amendment be less satisfactory than the text .
that be what we be wait to hear from the european commission .
mr president , I too would like to express my deep condolence to the family of those kill tragically in this ferry disaster , but also pay tribute to those involve in the rescue effort , not least of course , the royal navy .
on behalf of the socialist transport team , I regret the fact that this debate be take place as an urgency .
it could be more properly debate in committee next week , but that be the decision of the house which , of course , I respect .
what we certainly do not need today , or indeed next week , or in the future , be a point - scoring exercise between our greek colleague in the run - up to the general election in greece .
that serve no one & apos;s interest .
this be not a concern solely for greece .
it be a matter for europe as a whole .
this be an accident wait to happen .
some of we have work on the issue of ferry safety for many year , not least because other ferry in other part of europe have also sink with a tragic loss of life , be it the herald of free enterprise , the scandinavian star or , of course , most notoriously of all , the estonia in the 1990 .
all these demonstrate that ferry be not safe enough .
in our view , this tragedy could well happen again .
not because we have too few law in europe , but because the law be not properly enforce .
it be not just greece .
there be other member state that do not comply with maritime safety law and if I may , I will name some : italy , belgium , denmark , ireland and the presidency , france , be all fail to implement the port - state control directive .
I hope today , and in the come day and week , we will hear from the commission on what action they propose to take against these member state that do not take maritime safety seriously .
mr president , commissioner , I would like to join the name of my own group in express sympathy and solidarity with the family of the deceased and the survivor of the shipwreck and gratitude also to those involve in the rescue operation .
it be human nature to be the more affected by a tragedy the close it come to one .
if I speak with special feeling in this debate , it be because over the year greece have become another home to I .
I have have many opportunity during this time to observe just how skilful greek seamanship can be .
but the issue can not be localise in this way .
in recent year many other life have be lose at sea in our water , not only by way of major ferry disaster but , on all too frequent a basis , from amongst our fishing community .
that be why we have to address issue of maritime safety more generally and in the constructive way suggest in this motion .
I , too , would put particular stress on the need to implement properly the legislation we already have .
I would ask that we become even more cautious than we ever have be before about allow derogation from future legislation where matter of safety be concern .
nor be such issue important only for those of we who come from area where the sea be our highway or our place of work .
they be important for we all , even when we be not immediately affect .
this be so , if only because , in the word of the early english poet , john donne , any man & apos;s death diminish I because I be part of mankind .
mr president , on behalf of my group , I , too , should like to add our condolence to the family who have lose love one in this tragedy .
our thought be very much with they at this particular time .
as a member who represent scotland , I feel a particular sadness and concern too about these event .
although scotland and greece sit at the furth edge of the european union , we nevertheless share a common topography .
both our country have many island community around our shore and as such the people of scotland & apos;s island feel a particular sense of shock follow the recent event in greece .
our island community depend on ferry service as an absolute lifeline .
these ship provide transport for passenger and good and ensure the sustainability of some of europe & apos;s most remote and fragile community .
it be the duty of member state to make sure that the owner and operator of ferry be aware of their responsibility for the safe passage of people and good .
we be fortunate in scotland not to have directly suffer the type of tragedy to hit greece but we be only too well aware that our water be some of the most hazardous in europe .
we have many concern about the forthcoming tendering process which be under way .
I should like to ask the commission for some assurance that in tender for lifeline ferry service , or indeed any ferry service , safety be give its high priority .
in the cut - throat world of tendering , all too often company can be push into cost - cut measure and I would not like to see safety measure be sacrifice .
it be simply not acceptable to the northern and western isle of scotland , nor for the potential north sea to european mainland crossing which I hope will be establish in the not - too - distant future .
our citizen deserve the good of safeguard in sea transport .
the trade union who represent the man and woman who work on ferry , as well as representative of our seaboard community , ought to be involve in discussion at the pre - tender stage , so that they can play a role in ensure that safe practice be not sacrifice for the sake of profit .
mr president , allow I start by express by deep sorrow and sympathy for the victim of this tragic sinking .
it have be argue , include here in the house that the human factor be to blame .
this argument be the least unacceptable .
the legal framework for shipping in greece and in the european union in general have prove to be inadequate and dangerous and we need new , strict rule , especially for very old ship , rule without derogation .
equally dangerous be the modus operandi of the regulatory authority and the shipping register which , by operate as a private , profit - make company , be basically control by the very shipowner it be suppose to be control .
even the tragic shipwreck have not throw up any useful conclusion .
on the contrary , innocent victim be be exploit in order to promote shipowner & apo ; wide objective .
hurry to suspend cabotage in greek sea , as earnestly call for , include in this joint resolution , will intensify profit - seek competition between the shipping company , with even more tragic consequence for passenger .
mr president , my group would also like to express its condolence to those involve in the samina express disaster .
such a disaster be always a sad event , especially if it could have be prevent .
let we therefore hope that the inquiry into the cause can give we a clear picture of the situation , at which stage it will be possible to take adequate measure .
judge from the survivor and those involve , we can already draw two conclusion .
disaster at sea be often cause by a lack of maintenance and a lack of staff who be both able and aware of their responsibility .
it be particularly tragic since this tragedy can also be put down to the lifting of eu legislation .
I be pleased that the greek government have now nullify this exemption .
the european union should be very wary when grant exemption to eu legislation , particularly when public safety be at stake .
I would , in this light , refer to two other southern country that would like to join the european union in due course .
the quality of both ship and staff under their flag be rather more notorious than renowned .
we can not afford to make the same mistake again .
on a final note , I would just like to say that great human suffering force we to draw lesson from this tragedy .
it be unfortunate that we still have to learn the hard way .
this resolution point we in the right direction .
mr president , as you be aware , bavaria , more than any other german land , have an extraordinary affinity with greece .
this have its effect in the 19th century , during the war of liberation .
the first greek king be a bavarian , and it also have its effect in the present day , in that a particularly large number of people from bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country .
there be particularly large number of bavarian tourist in greece .
therefore it come as a double shock to we to have to see these terrible picture and hear this dreadful news .
it be a shock because family suffer so badly as a result , and because we mourn the loss of human life , but it be also a shock because it reveal a flagrant disregard for safety .
we must be aware that when something like this happen , the credibility of the european union also come into play .
time and again , we rightly complain that there be too much of a centralise drive in various area .
we criticise any attempt to formulate a common european tourism policy , which some people here want .
that be something we can confidently leave to the member state and region .
accord to the principle of subsidiarity , tourism policy be something that should be devolve to member state level .
but what people in all country must be able to depend on in equal measure , be safety standard .
that be precisely why it be one of the european union & apos ; s most important task to ensure that exception be no long make where safety standard be concern , as have obviously be the case here .
we must be in no doubt that , particularly in an era of cross - border mass tourism , whether it be tunnel - where there be a spate of disaster last summer - or ship , which have be involve in a great many disaster in recent year , people expect to be able to depend on safety standard within the european union .
human error happen all over the world .
greek sailor be excellent and famous for be of a high standard .
but what we must realise be that when it come to technical standard , there be , I be sorry to say , a degree of chaos in this region .
this be the point at which the european union and the european parliament must take direct responsibility .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the commission share the deep sorrow and consternation feel throughout greece over this horrendous accident .
the commission have express its sympathy to the family of the victim and the greek government .
unfortunately , this be not the first accident of its kind in european water and , as I be sure you know , the european union take decisive measure after the last serious ferry accident , the estonia disaster in 1994 .
a series of far - reach provision be introduce in order to improve the safety of ferry passenger .
as you will recall , the purpose of the provision introduce at that time be to ensure : first , that passenger be register .
secondly , that harmonise safety standard be apply , include in relation to stability and rescue equipment for inland traffic in the european union .
thirdly , that compulsory survey and investigation be carry out after accident .
fourthly , that social standard be maintain on board and , fifthly , that the shipping safety code be apply to ferry operator company .
as a result , domestic and foreign voyage by passenger ferry to or from union port be cover by a complete legal framework .
it be the commission & apos ; s job to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within its remit as set out in the treaty .
the commission therefore contact the greek authority as soon as the express samina go down , request clarification of the application of community law .
the commission ask the greek authority to check if the ship require to adopt the community & apos ; s safety standard by 30 september have in fact do so .
as a result of the check request by the commission , 60 ship be take out of service pende proof of compliance with standard .
the commission fully endorse the european parliament & apos ; s view that safety regulation applicable to passenger ferry now need to be tighten .
the member of the commission responsible , vice - president de palacio , therefore intend to include the question of revise the current directive on safety standard for passenger ferry in its work programme for 2001 .
the commission also intend to conduct a detailed examination of passenger transport liability regulation , in order to ascertain if they need to be change .
finally , I should like to stress that the commission be convince of the need to make european legislation on the safety of passenger ferry a top priority and to ensure that this legislation be apply strictly and uniformly throughout the community .
only thus will we contain the risk of a repeat of such accident .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place today at 6.00 p.m .
honourable member , we have finish the last debate and there be a short time leave before the start of the debate and statement by mr solana , the high representative for the common foreign and security policy on both the situation in the middle east and the election in yugoslavia .
we shall therefore take a short break .
mr president , as you just say , the debate with mr . solana be not due to start for another 25 minute , despite the fact that there be a great many urgent question which can not now be deal with .
we have finish early nearly every thursday afternoon over recent week .
there be nothing on the agenda this evening after the vote on the plumb report and tomorrow morning & apos ; s agenda be almost non - existent .
it seem to I that a curious discrepancy be start to take shape .
on tuesday and wednesday , there be considerable delay .
question time with the commission start nearly one and a half hour late and yet thursday & apos ; s agenda be disappear before our very eye .
the question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the bureau to clarify be if , having do away with friday , certain party be now try to do away with thursday .
we all know that you strongly advocate friday sitting and you be perfectly within your right to do so .
I think your point deserve discussion .
we have take note of it and I personally shall ensure that this aspect be discuss in detail at the next bureau meeting .
the sitting be suspend at 4.36 p.m. and resume at 5 p.m .
situation in the middle east - election in yugoslavia
the next item be the statement by the high representative for the common foreign and security policy on the situation in the middle east and the election in yugoslavia .
we be delighted to welcome mr solana , and I shall waste no time in invite he to speak .
thank you , mr solana .
like mr solana , commissioner verheugen will be speak on the two issue on our agenda this afternoon , which be to say the middle east and the election in yugoslavia .
afterwards the member of parliament who have put their name down will speak .
I think the group have arrange that they will speak on the first issue initially , and then on the second .
madam president , high representative , honourable member . I agree with the high representative & apos ; s observation on the situation in the middle east and on the situation in belgrade .
allow I to start by say a few word on serbia .
during the election on 24 september , the serbian people oust milosevic and his regime .
the serbian people vote clearly in favour of a new beginning with new political leader .
the european union have always make it clear that the serbian people have as much right to be in europe as any of the other people of europe .
we have always make it clear that we would radically revise our policy towards serbia if the serbian people vote at the election in favour of the opposition and , hence , democratic change .
we make it clear - and I should like to reaffirm this - that any decision in favour of democratic change would also be a decision to return to europe .
there be not the shadow of a doubt that this message be hear in serbia and the serbian people have cast their vote .
the victory have be win , although the regime have make and continue to make huge effort to forestall it .
the question of whether democratic change can now be introduce and if it can be introduce without violence will perhaps be decide in the next few hour on the street of belgrade .
allow I to say loud and clear : europe unreservedly support the democratic opposition in serbia .
we call for the voice of the serbian people to be hear and respect and we share its burn desire to see the back of milosevic and his cohort , who have bring so much suffering and unhappiness to so many , both in serbia and in several other country .
as soon as the will of the people be respect - and it will be , of that I have no doubt - what have happen in serbia will create an opportunity for real , last peace in the balkan .
it will give the serbian people the chance to rejoin the european family of nation and to build a peaceful and stable future together with its neighbour .
if the serbian people bring about democratic change - and the european union promise this a long time ago - the federal republic of yugoslavia will enjoy the same benefit as its neighbour and the european union will maintain the same relation with it .
we must be prepared to keep this promise as soon as the will of the people be respect .
as mr solana have already indicate - and I can confirm that the commission be already work on reconstruction aid for the serbian economy and infrastructure - this aid will come to fruition as soon as a democratic government be in office .
we be prepared to lift sanction and provide emergency aid against the harsh winter condition .
the president of the commission comment last week that this be an immense task which we must tackle immediately and without delay , as soon as the will of the people be respect .
I think that the signal which this debate send to belgrade today will be decisive .
the message which parliament must send can only be to urge milosevic one more time , perhaps for the last time , to see the writing on the wall , step down and pave the way for democratic change in serbia .
( applause )
I should like to make a few comment on the dramatic and rapid development in the middle east .
we feel deep sorrow and sympathy for the numerous victim .
it be mainly palestinians who have fall victim to the conflict which have re - ignite over the last few day .
we can not be harsh enough in condemn the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force .
we condemn any action which deserve to be see as provocation , especially in connection with the holy site in jerusalem .
we welcome and support the effort be make by president chirac , president mubarak and secretary of state albright and can only hope that the supreme objective of end the violence and restore peace and order will be achieve .
on the question of the committee of enquiry , the commission support the presidency & apo ; s stance .
obviously , this crisis may have dangerous repercussion on the peace process .
we share this concern .
nonetheless - and I take the same view here as mr solana - it would be premature to consider that agreement between israel and palestine be now out of the question .
the window of opportunity will be open until the end of october .
after that , the stability of prime minister barak & apos ; s government will be in jeopardy and there will be tremendous pressure on president arafat to declare statehood .
I hope that the meeting between president mubarak , president arafat and prime minister barak in sharm el sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement .
it be our job to convince israel that recognise and respect the right of the palestinians , with all the compromise which that imply , be the good way of safeguard its long - term national interest .
israel & apos ; s long - term interest lie in last peace .
we must convince the palestinians that the good way of achieve their objective and safeguard their right be to negotiate with israel .
I should like to reaffirm that the european union support the peace process because it be the only mechanism which can make the only possible alternative for israel and the palestinian people come true .
fair , comprehensive peace , even if it mean painful compromise on both side .
however complicate the issue may be , the party must grab the historic chance which they now have .
anything else would be an awful tragedy .
negotiation should build on the progress make in camp david in july .
this progress be not directly tangible , to be sure , because the summit as a whole be not successful .
but nor be camp david a failure , because the gulf between the party be clearly narrow and some serious taboo be overcome .
the european union & apos ; s stand on the substance of the peace process have not change .
we support the party in negotiate an agreement in keep with the principle and reference of the peace process set in motion in madrid .
we be convinced that a compromise can be find on all the point at issue .
we be also prepared to make a contribution and provide help .
if , as we hope , the party manage to conclude an agreement , the european union will add its political and financial support to the effort be make by other on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden and will meet the party & apo ; demand to a reasonable extent .
we be prepared to work on secure stability in the region and , in the long term , on safeguard the permanent welfare of the region through sustainable economic growth and an improve standard of living , so that the people in the region can reap the benefit of peace .
this philosophy be in complete accord with a strong barcelona europe - mediterranean process and we shall continue our effort within the context of that process .
thank you , commissioner verheugen .
I know from experience that it be a lot more difficult for an army to win peace than a war .
I know that the transition from fight to peacekeeping require troop who be capable , not of unleash violence from their weapon in the conquest of an objective , but of control that violence .
that require special training , standard now for soldier in european union army , because we be lucky enough to be at peace .
the force of israel and palestine be not so lucky .
it be up to we to take our place beside the united nations and the united states of america and , in close cooperation with they , to continue tirelessly support all those who have the determination to succeed at the price of the necessary concession .
and I have one question , mr solana : surely the time have come for an intelligent and courageous initiative by the european union on the status of jerusalem ?
we all know that be the crux of the matter and we have not forget the interesting proposal we have hear on this subject in this very chamber , which deserve our support .
madam president , I want to begin by express my deep sympathy with those family who have be affect by the late bloody event that have take place in the area we be talk about .
like other , I also want to express my concern about what be happen and , at the same time , say that , whenever this area be talk about , the impression give be really one of cross a minefield and of its not take very much to provoke a reaction , almost no matter what be say .
I too , however , must urge both the commissioner and mr solana to do everything in their power to press for the successful achievement of a ceasefire agreement , so that the bloody event in question might be bring to an end .
if that do not happen , a chain reaction might be trigger , in other country too , which might prove to be uncontrollable .
a minor example of this be the event that take place yesterday in copenhagen when a peaceful demonstration turn violent . happily , no - one be kill as a result , but unfortunately a number of people be injure .
what we in the eu must and shall do , therefore , be continue talk in term of negotiation , negotiation and , again , negotiation , so that those window which be now open do not close before we have achieve a result .
a peace agreement be need now . otherwise , there be a strong possibility of thing end in disaster .
madam president , my contribution today be not base on all kind of theoretical analysis but on my own experience over the past week , because I happen to be in jerusalem and the gaza strip when the disturbance take place .
on that basis , I would like to make three observation .
firstly , I would like to comment on mr sharon & apos ; s provocation on thursday .
it be clear from the outset that the issue be one of internal party - politic , namely the battle between sharon and netanyahu .
in my view , what be far more damaging be the fact that this provocation be condone by prime minister barak , who , in my view , either make the huge mistake of wrongly gauge the implication of mr sharon & apos ; s visit , or make a conscious attempt to bring the whole situation to a head .
secondly , I would like to turn to the disturbance at the al aqsa mosque on friday .
the next day , I talk to various people who visit that mosque and it be really incomprehensible that various man in their fifty and sixty - i.e. not those throw the stone - be shoot at in the mosque .
talk of provocation , I find it extremely shocking that the israeli government should shoot people who be pray in the mosque on temple mount on the holy day of the muslim , and I believe that the international community be entirely justify in its condemnation of the incident .
my final comment concern a visit to the hospital in eastern jerusalem the next day . in fact , I have quite a few observation regard that visit .
I find it extremely shocking to see that during the disturbance , an ambulance driver be shoot .
in another incident which I witness with my own eye , an ambulance driver be shoot in the foot from a ten centimetre range as he be try to come to the rescue of some people . the most shocking of all be the fact that the israeli police and the army use fragmentation bullet .
these be bullet which , upon contact with the body , shatter into dozen of piece . they be ban internationally , even in battle amongst soldier ; yet they be now use against citizen .
my conclusion be that the israeli government have apply excessive force which have be widely condemn , and rightly so .
my question to mr solana and the commission be the follow : what could the european union do in very concrete term in order , first of all , to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbance , and secondly , to bring the peace process back on track ?
madam president , mohamed be one of the many baby kill by the israeli army . eight year on from the signing of the peace agreement , the army still occupy over 80 % of the territory .
the settler have open fire .
how can we describe these new massacre and this palestinian rebellion .
more stone - throw youth ?
it be more than that .
the palestinian security force be also fire .
ariel sharon be the catalyst but the responsibility also lie with the government which allow he to visit the holy site and do not stop the soldier fire on the crowd .
while condemn all form of violence , we can not make any parallel between the israeli violence and the palestinian violence .
on the one hand , there be a state and an army occupy a territory in breach of all international law and , on the other , there be a people who be tired of suffering and humiliation .
this be not the work of hamas : it be the uprising of a people who have have enough of be oppress and be not be give satisfaction even by their own leader and decision - maker .
it be the revolt of the palestinians who live in israel who be not only demonstrate their solidarity with their brother but demand to be treat as citizen with full right and to be allow to live free from discrimination in israel .
we must play our part in bring the violence to an end and re - establish negotiation : the fighting must cease , the israeli soldier must be withdraw , there must be an international inquiry , at which europe must be present , and the palestinian people must be protect .
it would be enough for the european union and the un to make it clear that the un resolution , start with resolution 338 , 242 and 194 on the return of refugee to their home , apply .
this would in itself have a major impact and could change israel & apos;s - by now - firm conviction that it can always do whatever it like with impunity .
the right of the state of israel to exist and to security be very important to we , as be the israelis themselves who , together with the palestinians , be currently demonstrate that they have have enough of occupation and enough of this violence .
but the right of the palestinian state be no less important .
in my opinion , europe can and must do a great deal in this direction , and it must be clear and resolute .
it be true that peace be achieve through dialogue but right have to be respect , and here right be not be respect .
it be not a question of the israelis make concession ; we must enforce the law .
madam president , the bloody confrontation which have take place in the last few day in jerusalem , the gaza strip , the west bank and israel be particularly serious , because of the high number of victim and also because they have bring renew talk of exclusion as regard the state of israel , talk that we think belong to the past and which be dangerously irresponsible .
the violence , the unacceptable provocation , the disproportionate reaction against the palestinian people must not become a pretext for question the fundamental right of both people , israeli and palestinian , to have a state to ensure expression of their nationhood .
some of the statement that have be make - here , even , and elsewhere - be disturb .
they be not likely to make negotiation any easy , quite the contrary .
the event of the last few day demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process be .
so we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible .
the only effective way of do that be through intergovernmental talk and mr solana , who have just leave we , be right to concentrate his effort in that direction .
and here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the united states , france and egypt in particular .
the main lesson to be draw from these grave trouble , the source of which have be jerusalem , and more specifically the temple mount and the al aqsa mosque compound , be that as long as the negotiation on jerusalem and in particular on the holy place be put off , peace can not be definitely assure .
it be absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side consider it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the holy place .
so , negotiation should concentrate on the possibility of make the most sensitive area neutral , and why not revive the proposal make here on 2 september by the chairman of the palestinian legislative council , mr ahmed qurie ?
I think this avenue ought to be explore as soon as possible , because until the jerusalem question be resolve , it will continue to be the source of periodic confrontation likely to degenerate in the same way as the tragic event we be currently witness .
madam president , there be no doubt that europe would be well advise to seize the opportunity present to we here by the chairman of the palestinian legislative council .
madam president , I have just be talk to the group chairman in the front row .
I have not yet have a chance to talk to the other far up , but we be entirely in favour of your make a statement express what I believe be the unanimous feeling of this parliament towards the serb people .
that be the most direct method and we hope the message can reach those people in their heroic struggle for democracy .
thank you for that proposal , mr barón crespo , and for your confidence in I .
madam president , lady and gentleman , I have one minute to put my position on an issue which have be close to my heart since 1967 . the evidence seem to be that the state of israel have no intention , and never have have any intention , of negotiate seriously with palestine and grant it all the power of a sovereign and independent nation .
the state of israel see many advantage in this situation of latent conflict and do not hesitate to make use of they .
whatever the allege good intention of certain israeli leader , nothing have really change for the palestinians .
colonisation of the occupy territory be increase .
the economic dependence of palestine be increase .
access to the muslim holy place be be make more and more difficult .
the palestinian leader be in a no - win situation .
the fact be , they either accept perpetual talk , generally under the auspex of the united states , and endorse the expansionist policy of the state of israel or , with the aid of other muslim country and their traditional friend , they create a new and more favourable balance of power .
this new balance of power call , in particular , for the immediate proclamation of a palestinian state , the use of oil as a weapon and more organise recourse to legitimate defence .
madam president , the peace process in the middle east be extremely fragile .
such a situation require tact .
provocation such as those initiate by mr ariel sharon , must be refrain from .
however , violence be not a legitimate response to provocation , and call on the population to use violence certainly be not .
if the european union want to be a reliable partner in the peace process , it will have to unequivocally condemn provocation and call for violent action .
to this end , my group have table two amendment to the resolution to that effect .
it be not acceptable only to condemn israel if the palestinian leadership be still use violence as a possible tool in the negotiation .
it be heartrende if child be sacrifice in a battle which should be settle around the negotiating table .
the position of jerusalem be a moot point in the negotiation .
I call on this parliament to follow the biblical line : pray for peace in jerusalem so that the jews and arab can live together in peace .
madam president , over the last few day , we have watch the dream of peace in the middle east disintegrate .
the horrify picture of child run for cover be kill and of civilian be fire at from tank and helicopter give we just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both side , israel and palestine , if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process as quickly as possible .
that be the most important aspect at the moment , not apportion blame and condemnation .
the european union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it .
however , I be not prepared - as I have be urge on several occasion , purely in order to appear fair - to refrain from call the event of the last few day by their proper name or from make the same demand on both side , as if the provocation and force be divide equally between they .
or should I call on the hamas leader scheich yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visit the wail wall on the sabbath in order to provoke the jews pray there ?
should I perhaps call on the palestinian army to withdraw its tank and helicopter from israeli town and village and stop fire on civilian israelis ?
should I perhaps call on the palestinian army not to shoot any small israeli child cower behind wall and try to take cover behind barrel ?
I be not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness .
but I be prepared to call on my fellow member in the house to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter - productivity , as mrs albright say , in order to gloss thing over , purely to appear fair towards both side .
in this respect , I be most grateful for the clear statement make by my fellow member mr lagendijk .
madam president , I think the text of this resolution be a perfect demonstration that europe will never act as a mediator between israel and palestine .
once again , there be confusion between , on the one hand , a democratic state do its good to deal with an extremely difficult situation and , on the other , the institution at the heart of palestine which , under provocation certainly , immediately take up arm to shoot at the israeli force of order .
that be happen again today , and that be what will prevent , and have prevent europe from act as mediator in the middle east all these year , leave the united states to fulfil that role alone .
finally , regard serbia , I would like to tell mr barón crespo that he and his group might at least have the good grace to keep quiet on the subject , give that throughout the previous parliament his group be willing to go to any length to block any action design to bring milosevic to justice , and when a majority be achieve it be not with the support of the socialist group .
madam president , fellow member . it be of course difficult , as event unfold in belgrade , to sit here calmly and give a speech which be prepare before all this come to pass .
I expect today & apos ; s event to take place last monday .
we all know that the people have storm parliament , that the television station , which have be fully occupy by the army , have be storm and that army vehicle and the police be now out in force in the middle of belgrade .
we can only hope that all the people hide behind the army and behind the police - all of whom be essentially there to serve the people , not a dictator such as milosevic - will think twice before turn against the peaceful demonstrator .
since democracy raise its head again in serbia last monday , the possibility of serbia soon rejoin the european family be now a real possibility .
the result of the election on 24 september have make a democratic change of direction possible .
I should like to congratulate everyone who help to achieve it : the democratic opposition and , most importantly , the people and the leader of the democratic organisation , mr kostunica .
I think that , in he , we have a man who understand both the serb and our concern and with whom we can discuss a qualified procedure for bring serbia close to europe .
since 24 september , milosevic can no long claim to be an elect ruler .
everyone , include his own citizen in serbia now clearly see that he be a dictator , who be use all the brutal , ugly and contemptuous instrument of dictatorship in his own country .
special police unit , dirty trick and deception , quasi - legal procedure which he be use in a bid to hush up the fact that the people be sick and tired of he .
he have manage for year , with the help of his propaganda machine and by exert brutal pressure on the medium , to deceive the people in his own country and , unfortunately , many in the western world , to whom he have misrepresent the real situation .
at last , all that be at an end .
the people in serbia have express their will in democratic election and they be painfully aware of the fact that milosevic have no intention of respect this will and be think only of hang on to power and maintain his contemptuous regime .
which be why we must support serbia in its bid for freedom .
those who have fight for peace in south - eastern europe for year now and who be familiar with the situation in the region , know how difficult the fight against authoritarian ruler and tyrant in most of these country be and , in place , still be .
sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect they to follow our view and our way of thinking , which do not fit in with their tradition and which be irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset .
I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contact in serbia , who may well not understand we immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand we , partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural difference which I have mention .
I should like straight away to warn against interpret any such initial difficulty in communicate with the newly elect president as a sign of irreconcilable difference between we and the advocate of democracy in serbia .
there be no such difference .
we can help they on the path to europe .
if we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in serbia and push the so - call quick start package through at long last , then we must do more than just talk .
I therefore call on the commission and the council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanction , because these sanction have make 200 000 people in serbia rich and rich and 10 million people poor and poor .
please help we to give the people a glimmer of hope , with kostunica , so that we can all nurse some hope for serbia .
( applause )
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman . we be delighted to hear that the people of yugoslavia , mainly in belgrade but also in other town , have know how to take their fate into their own hand and have do so .
however , our delight be taint with fear that there may be bloodshed , that not everyone want to and can accept the voice , power and strength of the people .
everything must therefore be do to prevent bloodshed , because a civil war in yugoslavia or serbia would be a veritable disaster .
mr dupuis , you have abuse this truly historic moment here in order to engage in political demagogy .
I have only one thing to say to you : my group and I be unequivocally in favour of bring milosevic to justice before the court in the hague .
that have always be our objective ; but we have a still high objective , which be to avoid bloodshed and we shall do everything we can so that bloodshed be avoid .
the commission and the council will do their part and that be what be currently at the top of the agenda in yugoslavia and that be what we have be interested in all along .
we shall not sacrifice the serbian people to our noble and moral objective , because that would mean that perhaps thousand of people in serbia and yugoslavia might die for they .
secondly , we be in a very delicate position and , therefore , we too trust that there will be fast change in yugoslavia and serbia , because the situation be not easy in either montenegro or kosovo .
here , too , I have one thing to say : we have support the effort with which the people have defend themselves against the brutal force emanate from milosevic in both kosovo and montenegro , but under no circumstance do we support the concept of ethnically clean state .
kosovo must be independent come what may and montenegro must be independent come what may , just to ensure that serbia be weaken .
madam president , despite his twisting and squirm we be probably see milosevic & apos;s final moment in power .
it be a power that he have abuse cynically and he be now try to cheat democracy .
we be certain that mr milosevic will fall , possibly this evening , certainly soon .
what we be see on cnn be more than the fall of milosevic .
it be the end of the dreary succession of 20th century european tyrant .
serbia be suffer the final pang of fascism on the fringe of our own union .
we will all rejoice when that suffering be over .
as the drama conclude it be the duty of this parliament , as a symbol of united free europe , to support the crowd outside the yugoslav parliament and to help mr kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate .
madam president , lady and gentleman , it be slightly bizarre that we should be discuss serbia in this chamber at a time when the serbian parliament building be go up in flame and hundred of thousand of people be on the street .
despite this , I would like to make an attempt at explain why I be positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment .
there be of course the support of hundred of thousand of people - the figure of one million have even be moot - who be prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help mr kostunica against the wish of mr milosevic .
there be also the late report on the role of the police , which , as have be apparent for some time , have be in doubt as to whether to continue to support the regime , and which , as it appear from the first report now come in , have opt to side with the demonstrator ; accord to the late report , the same could happen with the army .
there be also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation have resign , this be a signal , I believe , that he refuse to act as the extension and mouthpiece of the milosevic regime any long .
I would like to make two minor observation with regard to the future .
I wholeheartedly support the proposal and appeal by doris pack to reach the decision quickly , in fact as quickly as possible , to lift the sanction , because these have do far more harm than good .
finally , I would like to propose that a delegation from parliament visit serbia at the early opportunity , and once a new yugoslavian government have be instal , so that we , in tandem with this new government , can make plan for the reconstruction of a new serbia .
madam president , I be wonder how we can help democratic yugoslavia , consider the way in which event appear to be , or we hope they be , unfold now .
our group have confidence in our president and in the declaration which we have agree she should make .
however , madam president and commissioner , we need more than pretty word .
do not say in general term , & quot ; serbia belong in europe & quot ; , which be , after all , something which you have only recently discover .
we refer to yugoslavia but it be no help to mr kostunica if we appear to be imply that montenegro , for example , will secede .
and to ensure we do go beyond pretty word , do you intend to propose as quickly as possible that yugoslavia , by that I mean democratic yugoslavia , be include in the list of candidate country for the enlargement of the european union ?
we at least hope that you do .
madam president , slobodan milosevic & apos ; s late polling box fraud come as no surprise to we . it be an electoral manoeuvre which be ad nauseam reminiscent of an extremely poor political reputation .
precisely this unfeeling attitude be also make we fear the bad - and current event be bear out the word write by myself only a few hour ago .
be the yugoslav president really make way for his opponent and probably lawfully elect successor , vojislav kostunica , without any bloodshed ?
a press question indeed .
along with the serbian population , the western world would be only too happy with such a switch in power in belgrade .
however , a sense of relief should not be attend by reckless carelessness .
the european union and the united states be be warn about this from various quarter in the region .
they consider kostunica - in term of idea - just as much a great - serbian nationalist as milosevic , with all that entail for the montenegrin and kosovar .
in summary , should kostunica take milosevic & apos ; s place , the west would do well to make aid strictly dependent on his concrete effort to establish a constitutional state in serbia and yugoslavia .
madam president , I hesitate before ask to speak again because I notice that your press secretary just hand you something and I think perhaps you have receive the late news .
if you have not , I would be grateful if I might briefly read out the follow release from the german press agency time at 17.53 hour .
it say : several dozen member of the special police have join with the demonstrator in belgrade .
all the police deploy to guard the state television building storm by the protestor , have lay down their combat weapon and have ally themselves with the demonstrator .
this be report on radio index .
apparently at least one police station in the city centre have join the protestor .
that be the late at 17.53 hour .
madam president , lady and gentleman , it be clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this parliament , possibly usher in the end of one of the last buttress of a totalitarian dictatorship in europe .
it be of course difficult to determine how long the serbian population will need to continue fight before milosevic will actually disappear off the scene .
a unanimous stance on the part of the serbian population have prove extremely important , as it will continue to do so for the next couple of day and week .
this mean , at the same time , that the european union too will very much need to form a united front .
in this context , I deplore the fact that the dutch minister for foreign affair , fortunately abandon by almost all party in the low chamber , adopt a stance out of the blue which go against the unity of the european union and against the wish of the opposition in serbia . I believe this display a lack of earnestness , and be at the same time insult to his office .
it also signal an excessive drive to stand out from the rest , to the point where the life of people could be at stake .
I believe it be also important to establish at this time on what basis the high representative and the council will need to adopt their position .
will it be by large common denominator , or on the basis of a large majority in the council , which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue ?
in addition to establish unity in the union , this be also , of course , about recognise the fact that kostunica have win the presidential election .
I wonder if the commissioner have plan any step in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider kostunica to be the only lawfully elect representative of the serbian people , and the only partner with whom the european union be involve as from today .
naturally it be difficult to mention budget at this early stage .
the high representative explain this only a moment ago , but what we can do be to selectively lift sanction by way of send a message to the serbian electorate .
the neighbouring country will take a great interest in this too .
I hope that the council , in conjunction with the commission , will take clear measure in this respect in the short term .
it be not easy to gauge serbia & apos ; s future .
as we have already witness all over central europe , constitutional state and democracy do not blossom automatically after a revolution .
nationalism do not automatically disappear if a democratically elect president can be find .
we should therefore remain level - head and focus in our attempt to create opening for a development which will bring serbia nearer to europe , also from a moral - political point of view .
the debate be close .
I have receive three motion for resolution , pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rule of procedure .
the vote will take place shortly .
vote
madam president , lady and gentleman , it be as a friend of israel that I be explain tonight why I have vote for the joint resolution .
indeed , while I regret a certain ambiguity in the wording and while I do not accept the failure to mention that there be a multitude of palestinian group prepare to do anything to wipe out the state of israel and the israelis by mean of violence and war , it be my very friendship for the israelis that make I implore they to end the armed repression against child .
it be also my friendship for israel and my esteem for the palestinians that make I implore they to do everything possible to achieve peace , even if that mean great sacrifice on both side .
their security and their medium- and long - term existence be at stake and no doubt world peace too , at this moment .
mr president , if you will allow I , I would like to explain why I have abstain in the vote on the resolution regard the middle east .
I believe that in delicate matter such as these , preference should be give to a diplomatic stance and , as far as the specific content of paragraph 4 be concern , it do not comply with the standard for a balanced resolution , in my view .
especially with regard to the committee of inquiry , I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constitute committee of enquiry and that its competence must be clearly delineate .
mr president , there be a problem with the german urgent debate file - I do not know if the same apply to the other language version - in that it only contain the propose amendment of the gue group but none of the motion for resolution and not even the joint text .
that be a serious error .
if I have not be give information by mrs langenhagen , who be a first - class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert , I would not now know what I be suppose to be vote on .
please ensure that this do not happen again .
statement by the president on yugoslavia
mr president , I wish to comment on this morning & apos ; s agenda , which , as you know , be particularly lean , even though extremely important event be take place in europe and it be most striking that we have hold an entire part - session without have a single debate on the single currency .
last week , on 24 september , an extremely important referendum be hold , in which the dane reject the single currency .
yesterday , the european central bank raise its intervention rate by a quarter of a point , which lead to a further fall in the euro & apos ; s value .
there be two conclusion to be draw here . firstly , the public will never take any interest in our debate if parliament persist in side - step discussion on every important issue .
secondly , the euro be an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstance .
mr president , I just want to draw attention to the huge pile of document we need for vote this week .
I would like to congratulate the honourable member .
we have all be very industrious .
( laughter , applause )
thank you , mr rübig .
loan for project in croatia
mr president , the european investment bank grant loan to non - eu country , guarantee by the european union . the bank guarantee individual loan freely in accordance with its own criterion and not the precise guideline lay down by the eu .
however , the union have fix a ceiling for the loan it guarantee .
the loan be not guarantee one hundred percent and the council decide in december 1999 to guarantee just 65 % of the final total for loan for the period 2000 - 2007 .
for the rest the bank must itself obtain other form of security or cover the risk itself .
in practice there be no risk and the european investment bank would even be prepare to lower the percentage the eu guarantee .
there be a special guarantee fund in the union budget for loan from the eib .
for each guarantee , fund be transfer from a special reserve into the guarantee fund , with a maximum amount decide in the finance framework contain in the interinstitutional agreement .
in 2000 a maximum of 204 million euro can be transfer from the reserve to the guarantee fund .
technically 9 % of the sum for eib loan should be transfer from the reserve into the guarantee fund , a figure represent 65 % of the nominal value of the loan .
the guarantee fund in the budget be also use for macroeconomic aid to non - eu country .
it be a cheap way for the member state to grant development aid .
these loan be grant on political ground to the eu & apos ; s humble partner and they be guarantee one hundred percent by the guarantee fund , unlike the investment bank loan .
in macroeconomic aid it be often a question of the eu & apos ; s share in an overall package in which other source of aid be the world bank and the imf .
generally , financial aid to non - member country be grant in accordance with the economic and political behavioural criterion set by the imf - the more guarantee be give for investment bank loan , the less macroeconomic aid can be grant , and vice versa .
the guarantee fund can also be use to guarantee the euratom loan to support the development of core industry in non - member country , although no transfer from the reserve to the guarantee fund have have to be organise for these sort of loan in recent year .
in december 1999 the council decide the maximum amount for guarantee for the investment bank for the period 2000 - 2007 , and produce a list of non - member country that would be entitle to receive aid .
the european parliament adopt a position on the matter in a report by mrs rühle in autumn 1999 .
as parliament have be hear , the matter be no long be discuss in parliament with regard to the term and condition of the guarantee .
parliament must today decide a very simple matter : whether croatia should join that group of country to which the european investment bank may grant loan with an eu guarantee .
croatia be no long at war and democratic change have take place there .
so there be good ground for the country join the group of borrower , just as there be to increase the ceiling of the eib mandate .
if parliament could table amendment to the council decision it would certainly remind we of croatia & apo ; s unemployment and social problem , which be the result of that country be put on a slimme regimen , but there be no legal basis here for such amendment .
the same problem of legal competence will also apply in the decision to be discuss soon in parliament regard turkey join the group of those country receive loan guarantee give by the eu to the european investment bank .
parliament be bind to have a lot of condition it would like to impose on loan to turkey , but at the time we will be make a decision in practice with regard to just one word .
today we add croatia to the list of those receive guarantee and then it will be turkey & apos ; s turn .
in this connection we will at the same time make it know to the commission that next year the guarantee fund reserve will not be sufficient for guarantee the loan we can expect .
mr president , this proposal for a council decision with a view to extend , for the first time , the community guarantee for the european investment bank undoubtedly have a truly extraordinary scope .
before comment specifically on the issue raise by this proposal for a decision , I should like to express our support for it , since it endorse parliament & apos ; s position on relation between the european union and croatia .
for this very reason , I wish to state from the outset that I share the concern express by the rapporteur a few minute ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve , whose narrow margin could cause problem should any unforeseen event occur .
there be one decision that must be put in a dual context . we should consider croatia & apo ; s situation firstly from a strictly political point of view .
we must welcome the new political direction that be be take there , follow the legislative and presidential election .
the european union must encourage croatia to remain firmly ground in democracy and the rule of law and there be no doubt that this encouragement must be translate into action involve financial support to improve the economic situation there and to enable the croatian people to make the necessary sacrifice to balance out the fundamental deficit in their public account .
from the operational point of view , I believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that have be provide for in the current financial perspective , and the functioning of the guarantee fund require an improvement in the mechanism for achieve the objective of quality and efficiency in union loan that be give budgetary guarantee .
in this sense , the rapporteur & apos ; s analysis strike I as be an admirable starting point .
it do not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the eib .
the interinstitutional agreement provide for a series of three - part dialogue to take place within the budgetary procedure .
give this context and bear in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve , which be set at eur 200 million per year , there be no reason why we should not discuss the priority use of this margin in coming year .
our aim be clearly to improve the efficiency of the european investment bank . in order to achieve this , the commission must ensure that the most thorough assessment possible of its activity will be carry out .
we can not content ourselves with say that we have a reliable system of guarantee .
in the budgetary procedure for 2001 , our political group have maintain a strategy of pursue a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanism for monitor its performance .
it be time to call for the same objective with regard to the activity of the eib .
what be clear be that parliament can not restrict its role to passively assimilate the information supply to it by the commission and the eib , or to give its blessing to the decision of the council .
mr president , lady and gentleman , the report by the committee on budget under discussion , which recommend extend the community guarantee give to the european investment bank to loan grant to croatia , deal with two important matter .
firstly , the political situation in croatia have improve dramatically .
the new government be commit to political and economic reform .
that be an opportunity for the european union to continue once more with cooperation , which be interrupt in 1995 when croatia begin military action in krajina .
the other message be contain in croatia & apo ; s still very difficult economic situation .
for year the country practise an economic policy base on plundering , which have leave the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .
the rapporteur , esko seppänen , say quite rightly in the explanatory statement in his report that social condition in croatia be difficult and the community & apos ; s contribution to the reform process should also have a positive impact on the social dimension .
an important political change be see in croatia in the parliamentary election that be hold early this year .
the country & apos ; s inhabitant show by vote that they demand democratic change .
the new government be make up of a democratic frontline of six party , which have a firm majority in the country & apos ; s parliament .
the government have indicate it be rapidly recognise the value of european democracy and the rule of law .
in foreign relation it give priority to the integration of a euro - atlantic framework .
in its programme , the government be commit to such matter as a respect for human right and the right of minority , the repatriation of refugee , improve relation with its neighbour , and considerable economic reform .
legislation be already in place to achieve these aim .
development in croatia have swiftly lead to close relation between the eu and croatia after a gap of several year .
between the union and croatia there be an advisory work party in place , whose purpose it be to offer croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiation on contractual relation .
accord to the commission , talk on the stability and association pact with the country should be start as soon as possible .
the council decide in august that the tempus 3 programme , which relate to high education , should extend to croatia .
in july the commission free 10 million euro to support the repatriation of refugee .
the proposal under discussion contain a target figure of 250 million euro in eib loan for croatia for the period 2000 - 2007 .
with that sum , it be propose to finance basic infrastructure project and environmental investment , the development of industry and sme , housing reconstruction , urban renewal and tourism .
the plan be in accordance with project that be put forward by croatia at the regional funding conference hold in march .
croatia & apo ; s leader be commit to difficult but necessary economic reform .
the cure will be hard to endure , but , hopefully , the loan now be speak about will help to soften the negative effect of economic reform on the life of the people .
we also have to remember that croatia have good industrial manufacturing plant , a qualified and train workforce and excellent opportunity for the development of tourism , for example .
accord to a survey by the commission the country & apos ; s competitiveness in european market could be strengthen enormously with a raft of consistently apply and ambitious structural reform , but at present many croatian business still have problem compete in the free economy .
the event in the balkan and the future of the region be burn issue .
this week , in the wake of the presidential election , we have follow the situation in yugoslavia with bated breath .
the wind of change be blow in belgrade too .
the international community have already indicate it will support the serbian nation and sanction be be lift .
the european union and the european parliament have every reason to support positive development in the balkan .
instability in the region be a threat to europe as a whole .
we know that nationalism and poverty mean war .
ahead of we there be a massive amount of physical and spiritual reconstruction to take place and we also , for our part , have to clear the barrier to effective assistance .
unfortunately , interinstitutional discussion on next year & apos ; s budget - in particular section iv on financing - still appear to be very difficult for the time be .
hopefully , the sign of hope in croatia and now also in yugoslavia will encourage we to find a solution to the problem of the budget and its financial perspective .
mr president , last night we discuss the topic of serbia and the revolutionary change that be take place there .
in somewhat less dramatic style , croatia change government last year .
in any event , the election victory of the opposition be give the same recognition .
this be why it be possible to pick up where we leave off in 1995 .
the chance of achieve a stabilisation and association agreement have now be look into , and it be expect that negotiation on this topic will begin before the end of this year .
a delegation of the european union have be prime for action , and as you know , the summit at the end of november will take place precisely in zagreb , in order to give croatia the message that the country be welcome in european union circle .
this be why it be necessary for the economy to be rebuild .
in its recent past , croatia have witness dramatic change for the bad and widespread corruption .
let we not forget that , until recently , croatia be the classic example of a privatisation programme which have get completely out of hand , and which benefit only one individual .
this whole process will need bolstering , which will require enormous investment - investment in infrastructure , in the environment , but also investment in very risky operation .
as we all know , set up small and medium - sized business in that kind of country be risky .
thing can go wrong , and this also apply to the reception of refugee , an investment goal which be lack from the rapporteur & apos ; s report , unfortunately .
these too be risky investment .
it be therefore only justify that the mandate of the european investment bank will be increase by 250 million .
the european union be act as guarantor .
but this be exactly where the problem lie , because we be now at the same point where we be last night when we be discuss the subject of serbia , namely the fact that the council underestimate the actual cost to be incur in the balkan last year in berlin .
as a member of the committee on foreign affair , human right , common security and defence policy , I know that the member of the committee on budget have criticise I and my colleague for continually want more fund for the balkan , and for have to enter into negotiation with the council , which be not always that easy .
but there be very definitely a real problem .
I mention it yesterday when we be debate serbia and I be repeat it here .
it be not acceptable that the rift between the pledge and promise make by the european union on the one hand , and the reserve funding on the other hand , should be as huge as it be now threaten to become .
having speak fine word yesterday and having grant this guarantee today , the european union can not afford to arrive in belgrade empty - handed tomorrow .
I would therefore urge the fellow member but also , and mainly , the council , to stick as closely as possible to the commission & apos ; s proposal during the next couple of month of negotiation on the budget for next year and subsequent year , the reason be that , in my view , the proposal still provide the good estimate of the total cost in croatia , but also in other part of the balkan .
I would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the balkan .
I support the amendment by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , which be right in say that this loan be important , but that , in the final analysis , the overall programme , give the necessary financial backing , be more important .
mr president , lady and gentleman , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comment .
I be sure we be all agree that croatia must be give political assistance , but political assistance also entail financial support , because political stability be always a prerequisite to social and economic stability . this can only be achieve , of course , if there be an appropriate level of investment in this sphere .
there be not a moment to lose if the fall in gdp record for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in croatia be to be halt and reverse . in the final analysis , the only way to achieve this be through croatia develop self - support economic cycle .
the contribution under discussion , which would take the form of an eib loan in excess of eur 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007 , may not prove to be a milestone , but it would certainly help the process on its way .
the course of action propose by the commission and back by the report be the inevitable outcome .
however , the problem that have come to light and which be as yet unresolved , be something else altogether .
it be generally the case that new political challenge demand increase financial outlay , but not - I might add - at the expense of other .
mr president , live through these dramatic hour , we look to belgrade and hope that a process of democratisation will get underway there which will present we with a real democracy in the course of the next few year .
yet there be still a huge question mark hang over all this .
we want to support and welcome the process , but we must not get carry away .
croatia start build a democracy as long as ten year ago .
democratic election be hold there in 1990 , which the international community deem fair and free .
follow these election the former communist government , under the leadership of the present prime minister , mr racan , step down in a discipline manner and a new democratic development begin under the tudjman government . accord to the international community though , a few crack start to develop in this administration , and the situation go downhill from there .
we must now consider the big picture .
look back , not only do this country have to rid itself of the burdensome legacy of fifty year of communist government - and all central and eastern european state , include the candidate state still have their work cut out there - a third of this country be occupy by foreign troop under the dictator milosevic , who hold office at the time and be still in office today .
a third of croatia be occupy , and it be many year before the country be reunite and a democracy establish which - and this be a point worth emphasise - lead to a peaceful change of government .
the current administration do not take over under the condition face by , what will hopefully be the future government in belgrade , because the previous government in croatia step down after free and fair election , and then a new government take office .
it be therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in term of democratisation .
democratisation take place in croatia ten year ago .
we must also recognise what remarkable achievement there have be over the past ten year in term of build a market economy , democracy and a constitutional state .
mr langendijk be right , some colossal mistake be make with privatisation .
there be corruption on a massive scale , but if you take a look round the associate country , the candidate state , you will detect the same trend there .
the current democratic government in croatia and its democratic opposition , need our full support .
I therefore welcome the fact that we be go to take the decision today to adopt the guarantee payment .
but we must be clear in our own mind that this be only a first step in the right direction .
mr markov be right to point out that fund be scarce , and that this can only be a first step .
our aim must be to forge ahead down this path , not just by provide more fund , but , above all , by send out political signal .
to this end , we must at last conclude an association agreement with croatia , which will spell out that this be a european country that have a definite future as a member of the european union .
I therefore say & apos ; yes & apos ; to financial aid , and & apos ; yes & apos ; to this guarantee , but , at the same time , would call upon the commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply european , and now truly democratic and constitutionally govern country , and to include it in the list of candidate country , because I believe croatia have earn our full support .
this could send out a signal to the entire region and might lead to its rejuvenation .
mr president , these day , we can not talk about croatia without see it in the context of its neighbour serbia , where the people be now finally throw off the yoke of the authoritarian government clique . a clique which refer to itself as socialist , but manage to stay in power for more than ten year by use fascist method alone .
along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence , this also manifest itself in the fact that fear be instill in the people of serbia vis - à - vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticise the regime be proclaim traitor to their own country .
the same formula have be apply in croatia over the past ten year . croatia be not one of the state we have be discuss this week as be potential future candidate state of the union .
in many respect , the position of that country be the same as that of slovakia , which be now a candidate state .
up until 1918 , both region be rebellious section of hungary and boast their own language , culture and identity , but be thwart by the official state authority .
international pressure force they thereafter not to become fully independent , but to join new large collective state which be intend as melt pot for minor slavonic people , but they never manage to integrate properly .
when half a century ago , croatia and slovakia become nominally independent for the first time , they become vassal of the hitler regime .
in 1945 , the outside world agree that these state should cease to exist permanently .
with the benefit of hindsight , this be a silly move .
ignore the wish of those people to be able to make independent decision , provide the breeding ground for aggressive and authoritarian nationalism for year , a nationalism which have little consideration for the tragic legacy leave by the nazi era and which be hostile towards other people and democracy at home .
people hide behind tudjman and meciar because they see this as the only guarantee for be treat as equal vis - à - vis their neighbour who use to rule over they .
it be only now that all their reasonable demand have be meet and nobody doubt the right to independence any long , that nationalism be fade away and normal political alliance be emerge .
the nationalist recently lose political power in both country .
this could serve as a lesson for other strongly nationalist region .
the only way to eradicate nationalism be to meet all reasonable demand of those nationalist .
there be now every reason for treat croatia in the same way as slovakia and other central european country which can join the european union if they so wish .
the damage do by the war have not yet be clear , as we witness recently .
the country & apos ; s road infrastructure be vulnerable because dalmatia and slavonia form the two half of a pair of scissor , as it be , with bosnia be wedge in the middle , which , particularly in west herzegovina , be also populate by croat .
the environment in the large population concentration in zagreb , rijeka and osijek be at risk .
this set of circumstance will probably necessitate huge investment , which will not be repay until later on in the form of tourism and new industry .
this be why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangement at this stage .
along with the rapporteur , I do wonder whether the fund will be make available in real term , especially now it appear that serbia will also be need large fund shortly and the union & apos ; s budget be not be increase .
there be little point in the european union make pledge to crisis area and candidate state leave , right and centre , which it can not meet .
as far as croatia be concern , there be every reason to set up a financial arrangement .
the comment which my colleague mr papayannakis make yesterday about admit serbia to the european union should also apply to croatia .
there be another individual measure that have be well receive today .
of course we can not consider the issue of guarantee payment and the issue of croatia separately from the debate that take place yesterday evening and the development in belgrade .
we must immediately appeal to the military and the police , in no uncertain term , to throw their full weight behind democracy , and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power - which be trigger by the outcome of democratic election - proceed peacefully over the next few hour .
we have every intention of recognise these democratic election and the electoral victory of vojislav kostunica .
of course my country , austria , in common with all the other european country , will also have to do its bit towards the reconstruction of yugoslavia , in tandem with the european union .
we will also do everything in our power to ensure that the anticipated removal of sanction against former yugoslavia be implement in full .
our honourable friend , mr posselt , be correct in what he say about the development in croatia .
but we be all agree , nonetheless , that the parliamentary and presidential election that take place in january 2000 have produce a new political climate .
the new government have reinforce its commitment to political and economic reform .
this will have a positive effect on relation between croatia and the eu .
the european union & apos ; s response to this development have be not only to appoint the advisory eu - croatia task force , but also to develop the office of the special representative in zagreb into a permanent representative office of the european commission .
in the feasibility report on a stabilisation and association agreement with croatia , compile in may 2000 , the commission reach the conclusion that the condition for take up negotiation with croatia have be fulfil .
the delegation from the croatian parliament and from our own , have also call upon the council to extend the eib mandate .
the council hold in june establish that all the precondition to commence negotiation on a stabilisation and association agreement have be meet .
in july , the european commission forward the draft of a negotiating mandate to the member state , for they to comment on .
austria , the country I come from , be one of the first three member state , to make a positive statement .
the reason I mention this development in the year 2000 , after the election , be because it show that we need to do more than increase the guarantee fund .
we have already come a long way .
we must single - mindedly pursue the process that start in may and july as far as an association agreement .
croatia and the region deserve this in the interest of peace within europe .
mr president , first of all I must declare a personal interest , I have a son - in - law who be , and be , a refugee from the krajina in croatia .
even if it be now technically possible to return , much more have to be do to make the return of serb to croatia and the krajina in particular positively welcome .
much physical restoration be require in that sad part of croatia .
we in the european union must insist that this be positively encourage and not just a nominal gesture .
our financial contribution should be on that condition and I would appreciate a reassurance from the commission that this aspect will be take into account .
my second point refer to serbia itself .
even if there be the happy , democratic outcome , which we hope for in serbia , there will still be great resentment result from what happen with the kosovo campaign and our recent relationship with serbia .
this will not be overcome immediately .
we in europe must be prepare to rise above any peevish reaction to those sentiment .
the top priority , not just for serbia but for all the balkan include bulgaria and romania , be to restore normal transport link in the whole area and bring serbia with all its hurt back into the european fold .
I be grateful , on behalf of the commission , to mr seppänen for his report relate to the proposal to extend the exist community guarantee for european investment bank lending outside the union to cover intervention in croatia .
as the house will know and as have be remark again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential election early this year result in the change of government in croatia and bring a new political climate .
we celebrate that and we act as a community to support it .
but I can not let this debate pass without refer to another part of former yugoslavia which be begin the century with hope and the prospect of freedom .
I be speak of the glorious revolution take place now in serbia , thank to the courage of the serbian people and their insistence on democracy .
the house will know that the commission have make it crystal clear that european union sanction will stop with the advent of democratic government in serbia .
when it appear that milosevic have flee and the will of the people have prevail , we hope that action to establish normal relation and partnership between serbia and this union of democracy will only be day away .
meanwhile the new government in croatia be clearly demonstrate its serious commitment to put that country on a secure democratic path and to implement the political and economic reform necessary to adhere to the condition of the european union stabilisation and association process for the western balkan .
take account of those advance last may , the commission produce a positive feasibility report on the opening of negotiation for a stabilisation and association agreement with croatia and on 19 july recommend opening negotiation .
this constitute a major step forward in eu - croatia bilateral relation .
the commission hope that a decision can be take in november so that negotiation can start without too much delay .
it be also essential for the community to provide appropriate financial support for croatia .
the resumption of eib lending be intend to assist the country & apos;s investment activity in infrastructure and private sector development .
the new croatian leadership clearly need dependable and sustained backing to pursue demand reform .
the proposal before the house would cover up to eur 250 million of lending over the next four year .
as mr purvis have just say - and I fully acknowledge - that must be regard as part of a process of normalisation , stabilisation and progress that extend over many year .
the rapporteur have not propose any amendment .
I therefore thank he and the house for support this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent .
( applause )
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate be close .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
( parliament adopt the legislative resolution )
explanation of vote
mr president , I want to be here not just to state that I vote for this aid for croatia but , above all , to have the chance to express my satisfaction , as other have today , at the democratic event take place in serbia at the moment .
after many year of difficulty for this people - all kind of difficulty - we be at last , extremely democratically , begin to welcome serbia back into the community of the people of the european union .
I hope that negotiation will soon get underway and , as with croatia , that aid will also be grant to the serbian people , who deserve our great respect .
thank you , mr fatuzzo .

... I explain , then , that speaker on procedural motion would be cut off after one minute , as expressly stipulate in the rule of procedure , in rule 141 , to be precise .
I should just like to point that out .
your applause today , as well as the applause I hear on the tuesday of the last part - session , confirm that you endorse this approach .
madam president , it be quite right that the municipal election in himara be mark by violence and fraud at the expense of the greek minority live there .
that this happen be beyond question .
we have the finding of international organisation which monitor the election .
albania be a country whose own minority have suffer persecution at the hand of other country and , as we all know , the international community react to this persecution .
it should not repeat inside its border what it suffer outside its border ; that is , I think , the first lesson in democracy which we should bring to the attention of this country , which be start to establish an internal democracy .
I should like the european parliament to take note of these violation and , of course , to call for repeat election in himara .
we will make an appeal on tuesday and wednesday and collect the name and signature of those woman who wish to be part of the delegation . our intention be to build bridge of peace between woman in place where violence prevail .
madam president , I would just like to inform the two greek speaker that the next meeting of the south - eastern europe delegation - in the course of which we will also receive representative from albania - will also address this issue , and I be certain that with mrs pack in the chair , we will approach the matter objectively .
madam president , last week , the mep karla peijs be attack in brussels .
I would urge you to approach the belgian government again and to see to it that security level be step up in brussels .
indeed , mr rübig , I shall do so .
madam president , I have a question concern the statute for member .
my question be : who be speak for the european parliament concern this statute ?
I ask because when I read the public statement make by our colleague , mr rothley , I get the impression that we have appoint a saboteur and not a rapporteur .
I hope that you be speak for parliament rather than mr rothley .
madam president , I understand that you will shortly be announce the decision of the french government to terminate my mandate as a member of the european parliament .
I believe that this be a grave injustice and a penalty which be out of all proportion to the minor incident which serve as a pretext for it .
I receive no notice in order to prepare my defence .
I be not permit to waive my parliamentary immunity and I do not have the benefit of any of the defence that even a guilty party would have .
I believe that the european parliament have the opportunity in this case to , perhaps , demonstrate its ability to come to the defence of its own dignity .
madam president , there be more victim of eta , but there be also more victim of the spanish repression : more arrest , more people torture , new dispersal of political prisoner jail in the basque country .
all in all there have be more suffer for basque and spaniard ; certainly the spaniard and basque be feed up with the present conflict .
it be not surprising if they express their profound dismay more and more clearly because , with the exception of the spanish government , no one believe in the benefit of the ongoing strategy .
can the european parliament give up hope of ever find a democratic . . .
( the president cut the speaker off )
madam president , I do not wish to be repetitive , but the situation require it .
you be aware of the situation in campo de gibraltar , where there be a damage british nuclear submarine .
as we have fear and suppose since the start , accord to the technician , the significance of the damage be increase daily with the passage of time .
I ask you , madam president , to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the committee on petition concern a protest document that have be present by more than thirty social group and ngo against this situation , in which there have be a blatant failure to comply with community regulation on radiation protection .
madam president , firstly , I would like to speak as chairperson of the committee on legal affair and the internal market to point out , follow on from what mr haarder say , that mr rothley , first vice - chairman of the committee , be not a spokesman but a rapporteur , and I think that so far he have conduct himself impeccably within that mandate .
secondly , I would like to speak in support of mrs morgantini & apos ; s motion .
I think we be at a stage in the process in the middle east in which dialogue between palestinian and israeli female member of parliament and european female member of parliament could contribute to resolve this conflict .
madam president , if I have understand correctly , we be at present establish our agenda .
our rule of procedure do not admit any point of order at this juncture .
accord to the rule of procedure , we be allow procedural motion pursuant to rule 141 and point of order with reference to the rule of procedure pursuant to rule 142 , but not , in any manner of speaking , point of order , especially not to make the kind of representation we have just hear .
apparently , just anyone can stand up and say whatever they want when the agenda come up .
when oh when , madam president , be you go to apply the rule of procedure and nothing but the rule of procedure ?
let I answer you , mr goebbel .
this be a problem that everyone chair a sitting have to deal with .
the problem be determine whether a matter be ground for a procedural motion or not .
I feel that if we stop to discuss whether , every time a member wish to speak on a procedural motion , it actually comply with the rule of procedure or not , then we shall waste a great deal of time .
I think apply the minute rule be the least damaging solution , in the final analysis , as we have , in fact , see .
madam president , you will recall that at the last part - session I raise the plight of the british democracy campaigner , james mawdsley , who be hold illegally by the burmese authority .
you promise to convey your concern , and subsequently this house pass a resolution condemn his imprisonment .
that be part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the house will be pleased to have learn that mr mawdsley be release by the burmese authority last week .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you and member of this house for the part you play in see this process through to a successful conclusion .
I hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousand of other people who be political prisoner in burma and the lack of democracy which afflict that country .
madam president , when my fellow danish mep , mr bertel haarder , speak a little while ago , his danish be so garbled that it be completely impossible to understand what he be say .
could you not make sure that we can hear what he be say in future ?
it be really difficult to understand his danish .
madam president , last monday , antonio russo , the radio radicale correspondent , be find dead in georgia with his chest cave in . he be the only western journalist to remain in pristina , in kosovo , for a number of week last year .
the autopsy perform in georgia reveal that he be the victim of murder and have , in all probability , be torture .
antonio russo , a courageous journalist , be investigate the crime take place in chechnya , and it be our opinion that this be the reason for his tragic death .
I know that it would not be usual for parliament to hold another minute & apos;s silence - and I would not be so bold as to propose this - but I want you to be inform of the development , for antonio russo be a journalist and a very brave man who give his life for the freedom of information for all people .
madam president , pursuant to the second paragraph of rule 7 ( 4 ) of our rule of procedure , the president be bind to refer the matter to the committee on legal affair and the internal market before ratify the decision of the french government .
the council of state ruling , which you will perhaps be invoke as a defence very shortly , be issue by a body which have no jurisdiction in the matter , whereas french law stipulate that only plenary be competent to rule on the subject of the mandate of a member of the european parliament .
in the course of this procedure , madam president , the parliamentary immunity of our fellow member , jean - marie le pen , have be violate from start to finish .
I do not see how you can cite the charter of fundamental right , as you do a short time ago , without actually implement it in the exercise of your office .
madam president , lady and gentleman , the topic of violence be give priority status in this parliament and that be how it should continue to be .
far to your appeal and your expression of sympathy with the family of the victim of violence , we too would like to show our solidarity with all those who be protest today against the violence of eta in so many place in the basque country .
that be why , after approval of this agenda , we intend to hold a small , peaceful demonstration , which will take a few minute , in front of the parliament building , together with all colleague and delegate in this house who wish to attend .
madam president , it be not possible to let mr gollnisch impugn the supreme administrative court in france without respond . if he respect the rule of law , he would respect its jurisdiction .
as for mr le pen , what an affront to the dignity of the european parliament and for any true democrat to hear mr le pen use the word & apo ; dignity & apos ; !
madam president , I have a genuine point of order .
we have no urgent procedure this week , yet , chechnya , albania , burma and palestine have already be discuss .
my question to you be this : can we not change the rule of procedure in such a way that we no long have urgent procedure , but deal with these matter at the beginning of the sitting instead ?
( applause )
do you see , mr goebbel ? be this actually a procedural motion or not ?
believe I , we could spend hour and hour debate the point .
madam president , between 3 october 2000 and yesterday , at least seven memorial be desecrate , eight people be subject to racist attack , four hostel for asylum seeker be set upon , and seven synagogue , jewish cemetery or memorial be desecrate in the federal republic of germany .
just because , madam president , lady and gentleman , we be suppose to be discuss the order of business do not mean that we have to take order as to our business .
a number of member of parliament have have a fantastic dream , this I can understand .
they have dream of build the kind of federal state envisage by chairman spinelli , for instance , or turn our treaty into a constitution .
well , today , acknowledge that the jurisdiction of the european parliament be subject to a state , regardless of which one this be , and have a bounden duty to terminate the mandate of one of our fellow member , would be to admit that parliament be not a sovereign assembly and must yield to national legal or government authority .
madam president , lady and gentleman , we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream , one I do not , however , personally share .
simply by acknowledge that the european parliament have the discretionary power to settle the matter of the termination of the mandate , you will have go some way towards achieve your federal dream . otherwise , madam president , in yield to the authority of other , you be effectively take a step backwards .
a whole series of violation of the law - not just french law , but also european law - have take place and I feel it would be a grave mistake not to refer the matter to the committee on legal affair and the internal market or to hear mr le pen & apos ; s side of the case .
agenda
the final version of the draft agenda as draw up by the conference of president at its meeting of 19 october 2000 have be distribute .
relate to monday : I have receive a request from the group of the green / european free alliance to defer mrs klass & apos ; s report , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine , to a later part - session .
mr lannoye wish to speak as the author of this request .
madam president , mrs klass & apos ; s report have already be defer twice .
we would , however , like to request that it be defer for a third time for political reason .
the fact be , this apparently technical report , which do not seem to make any great change of a political nature , be extremely important insofar as it introduce the possibility of carry out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence end up with genetically modify viticulture .
we think , give that for the moment we be at the conciliation stage with regard to the framework directive on gmos , that it would be wise to await the conclusion of these conciliation proceeding and to deal with this problem once the framework have be clearly define , which should , in principle , be in the month of january .
we therefore propose postpone examination of this report .
mr lannoye have just present his group & apos ; s request .
be there a speaker to support this request ?
madam president , as we have already tell the rapporteur and the house repeatedly , there be an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulate or modify micro - organism , namely the report by david bowe , which we be currently deal with in the conciliation procedure .
this be the fundamental piece of legislation and it form the basis for any other piece of legislation govern genetically modify plant .
it be therefore only sensible , and indeed , right and proper , to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure , which will not be for another six week or so , and then take decision on all the other piece of legislation .
I therefore support mr lannoye & apos ; s amendment .
we shall now hear from the rapporteur , mrs klass , who , I believe , be oppose to postpone the report .
madam president , I be against postpone the report , and I question the way in which this house work .
the report be adopt in the committee on agriculture and rural development by a good majority and with only two vote against .
we be now embark on a discussion about the release directive 90 / 220 , which be inappropriate .
we be refer here to the release directive , and accord to the conciliation procedure , that be precisely what the speech will focus on .
we be do exactly the same as we have already do in the case of forest and plant material , i.e. we be make reference to the horizontal directive .
not vote on the report will lead to delay .
it will obstruct the trade in vine material in europe , and so I believe that in the interest of the single market for europe & apos ; s vine propagator , we must vote on our report .
( parliament reject the request )
relate to tuesday :
madam president , on behalf of my group , I would like to move that a particular item be include in tomorrow morning & apos ; s debate , namely a statement from the commission about an interview that commissioner verheugen give to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last friday , 20 october .
mr verheugen give the impression that , accord to the current state of play , the european union will have ten new member by 2005 and , what be more , and this be more disturbing still , he call into question the significance of majority decision in the council of minister , which be what we regard as the fundamental reform element to be deal with at the nice summit .
he have already be criticise within his own political circle for say this .
we would urge the commission to clarify matter tomorrow in its statement .
regrettably , this be now the second time that commissioner verheugen have say such contentious thing .
he be obviously make a habit of put his foot in it .
we urge the commission to clarify its position .
mr poettering , in tomorrow & apos ; s debate , every speaker will be free to raise any issue and to address both the council and the commission .
announcement of the removal of mr le pen from office
lady and gentleman , I must inform you that on thursday , 19 october 2000 , I receive official notification from the competent authority of the french republic of a ruling by the council of state on 6 october 2000 reject the appeal lodge by mr jean - marie le pen against the decree of the french prime minister on 31 march 2000 terminate his mandate as an elect representative to the european parliament .
I must inform you that , since that time , I have receive a copy of a request for clemency for mr le pen present to mr jacques chirac , president of the french republic , by mr charles de gaulle , mr carl lang , mr jean - claude martinez and mr bruno gollnisch .
I shall give the floor to mrs ana palacio vallelersundi , chairperson of the committee on legal affair and the internal market , to give we her view on the matter .
madam president , the committee on legal affair and the internal market , having deliberate at its sitting of 15 and 16 may , agree to recommend that the announcement in plenary of parliament & apos ; s confirmation of the removal of mr jean - marie le pen & apos ; s mandate be suspend .
I repeat , the committee on legal affair and the internal market recommend that this announcement be suspend until the deadline period that mr le pen be give for appeal against the french council of state have expire or until a decision by the latter .
and I be quote word for word from the letter date 17 may that you yourself , madam president , read in plenary .
as you say , the council of state reject the appeal and we be duly inform of that rejection .
there be therefore no long any reason for delay this announcement in plenary , which be an obligatory act accord to primary law , specifically paragraph 2 of article 12 of the act of 20 september 1976 .
the request for a reprieve that you mention , madam president , do not alter this situation , as it be not a legal appeal .
as its name indicate , it be an act of the prince , which do not affect the decree from the french government which , in accordance with the recommendation of the committee on legal affair and the internal market , must be announce in plenary .
thank you , mrs palacio .
consequently , pursuant to article 12 ( 2 ) of the act of 20 september 1976 on the election of representative to the european parliament by direct universal suffrage , the european parliament hereby take note of the notification by the french government of the termination of mr jean - marie le pen & apos ; s mandate .
mr le pen , please leave the chamber forthwith . in order to ensure that these proceeding go ahead in an orderly manner without affect the dignity of either this house or your own dignity , I propose to suspend the sitting for ten minute .
( the sitting be suspend at 5.40 p.m. and resume at 5.50 p.m. )
request for waiver of mr pacheco pereira & apos ; s immunity
the next item be the report ( a5 - 0304 / 2000 ) by mr maccormick , on behalf of the committee on legal affair and the internal market , on the request for the waiver of mr pacheco pereira & apos ; s immunity .
madam president , this issue arise from a request ( announce by yourself to the house on 17 february ) by the appropriate portuguese authority seek a waiver of the immunity of mr pacheco pereira in respect of proceeding in portugal concern word speak on a television programme some year ago .
the television programme involve a discussion about the respective role of politician and journalist .
mr pacheco pereira in that debate make remark about a third party not participate in the debate , to which the third party take exception .
initially , public criminal proceeding be initiate but these be drop and there be now a private action take place before the cascais first criminal court .
this be therefore a case involve the exercise of freedom of speech in a political matter .
the immunity of member of the house arise under article 10 of the protocol of the privilege and immunity of the european community .
the substance of this , for our present purpose , be that member of this parliament enjoy in their own member state the same immunity as would be enjoy by member of the national parliament of the state in question .
the committee on legal affair and the internal market , having look into the matter , be satisfied that , upon an issue of the kind before we , mr pacheco pereira , be he a member of the portuguese parliament , would enjoy immunity which could be waive only by the portuguese parliament .
therefore , under our rule , he enjoy immunity which can be waive only by decision of this parliament .
it be important that I should underline the point that immunity be not conceive as an advantage to a particular member , which she or he may waive or assert as she or he choose .
rather , it be an immunity assert by this house as a whole , in the interest of preserve the condition of effective , democratic politic and argument and of enable this house , through its member , to discharge its function properly in an all - europe democracy .
therefore it be for the house to decide whether the immunity ought to waive or not .
we do not do this arbitrarily .
we do it in accordance with precedence and practice establish over many year .
the conclude section of my report ought to be read out : & quot ; it be indisputable that dr pacheco & apos ; s comment on a television programme on the press qualify as part of a political debate and therefore paragraph 1 of article 157 of the portuguese constitution would be applicable .
under that provision he would have enjoy immunity be he a member of the portuguese parliament .
accordingly , he do enjoy immunity as a member of the european parliament in respect of statement make and opinion express in the television programme to which the case relate . & quot ;
it have be the practice of the house to insist upon uphold immunity in all case where to deny it would be to inhibit political activity of a legitimate and democratic kind .
on that ground , therefore , the legal affairs committee have unanimously come to the conclusion that , after consider the reason militate for or against the waiver of immunity , we recommend that the immunity of mr pacheco pereira not be waive by parliament .
madam president , the case of mr pacheco pereira have be carefully examine by the legal affairs committee : the recommendation , which be approve and which be table before the house today , be not to reject the request for waiver of parliamentary immunity .
the reference make in the protocol to national legislation do not mean that the european parliament be be pass over but be in connection with the procedure , while every parliament - include , in the case in point , the european parliament - preserve its authority in its autonomous decision .
when all be say and do , mr pacheco pereira be perform a political activity and can not therefore be consider responsible for any crime .
that be the position of the european people & apo ; s party . we would also like to point out that , if mr pacheco pereira have be italian , proceeding would have be bring against he without the european parliament know anything about it .
the italian judiciary do not ask for authorisation when the person in question be a member of the european parliament and ignore every principle of the respect due to this institution .
some member of parliament have already be take to court during this parliamentary term without a request be put forward for waiver of parliamentary immunity .
personally , I be not able to intervene to condemn these action in that it concern member of my own party who have always be political target , and my involvement would therefore have appear exploitative .
however , the incident have be repeat again , and this time , although the member concern be a member of the european people & apo ; s party , he be not from the same political party or persuasion as I be in italy .
proceeding be bring against mr cocilovo without parliament be inform , indeed in contempt of parliament .
this be an extremely serious matter , madam president , that you can not ignore .
the autonomy of the european parliament be at stake !
madam president , I certainly do not require the two minute allocate to I because , after the explanation from mr maccormick and the additional explanation by mr zappalà , from the point of view of the group of the party of european socialist of the european parliament , there be no doubt that mr pacheco pereira & apos ; s immunity should not be waive .
I would say that this be a really trivial issue , a few comment by a politician on a television programme , which have result in a criminal action that have no ground , and which be cover by the portuguese constitution and by application of community rule on the waiver of parliamentary immunity .
in short , here we have all the ingredient for mr pacheco pereira & apos ; s parliamentary immunity not to be waive and , therefore , the group of the party of european socialists agree with mr maccormick & apos ; s proposal that mr pacheco pereira & apos ; s parliamentary immunity should not be suspend .
social policy agenda
the next item be the report ( a5 - 0291 / 2000 ) by mrs van lancker , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affair , on the commission communication to the council , the european parliament , the economic and social committee and the committee of the region on the social policy agenda & # 91 ; com ( 2000 ) 379 - c5 - 0508 / 2000 - 2000 / 2219 ( cos ) & # 93 ; .
it have often be say that & apos ; social policy be a productive factor & apos ; and this be true , for a society with great social cohesion be also a society which perform well .
however , social policy do have its own right ; social policy must ensure that inequality be iron out , that social cohesion be promote and that people & apo ; s quality of life improve .
that be why this social agenda deserve a far more prominent position in european policy .
the lisbon summit have give we the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy ; we must seize that opportunity with both hand .
it be with great delight that I note that the commission and the french presidency want an ambitious social agenda , and I believe , commissioner and minister , that we fully endorse the objective .
I would therefore like to use some of my speak time in this debate to draw attention to a number of point which parliament would like to reinforce in this agenda .
the first point relate to the strategy . the social agenda must raise the profile of social europe among the citizen , and that be why we be in favour of define measure , priority and instrument more clearly and with great intensity .
we must be able to see where progress be be make ; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afford centre stage in the political discussion at european level .
hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard , similar to the one already in use in the internal market , which detail specific measure , expiry date and deadline .
hence also our appeal in favour of have social agenda discussion at the annual spring summit .
secondly , I would like to comment on the instrument .
it be true that the open method of coordination , which have be use within the sphere of employment since luxembourg , have bring fantastic new opening in field which up to now be only subject to national authority .
we would therefore ask that this method be reinforce and , as have now be decide by the social affairs council , be apply to combat social exclusion and poverty .
furthermore , we would very much like to see this major innovative method be deploy to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security .
thirdly , there be a & apos ; but & apos ; .
stress the importance of this open coordination method do not mean that this method should replace social legislation , because we should lay down social right in europe too . we should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standard and draft social legislation which be necessary within the framework of a european internal market .
parliament be of the opinion that the commission could lend a help hand here and there , for example where individual and collective worker & apo ; right be concern , where more security in new type of labour be concern , or as regard the protection of health and safety relate to new risk in the workplace .
in addition , we believe it be crucial that the european commission should take the initiative to re - establish the link with the & apos ; 92 recommendation in order to underpin member state & apos ; effort to guarantee everyone a right to a reasonable income .
only then can the fight against poverty be efficient .
needless to say , the social partner be major player when it come to achieve this agenda , where lifelong learning be concern for example , or the organisation of working time , and new form of work , and we hope that they will be prepare to negotiate within all these field .
however , commissioner , if this consultation do not yield result , we would also ask the commission to use its right of initiative to the full .
I would like to finish off by make two remark : as we endeavour to achieve the european social agenda it be essential to establish a close partnership , a partnership between institution , and with the member state , the social partner , but also with the many social ngo which have a key role to play in the realisation of the agenda .
here too , we believe that europe should take an initiative as a matter of urgency to reinforce this dialogue with the citizen and the dialogue with the social ngo .
finally , social policy should not be view in isolation . it must be integrate into all eu policy .
I be convinced that europe will only be social when a social dimension be add to economic policy , competition policy , external policy and the entire enlargement discussion .
I hope , minister , that the council will be inspire by parliament & apos ; s expectation , and I hope that you will succeed in set ambitious goal at the nice summit for a european social agenda , which we can work towards together over the next couple of year .
mr president , the propose social agenda send out a political message which do not go unheeded .
this issue provoke intense interest in society throughout europe and the committee on woman & apo ; s right have take account in its opinion of the numerous proposal submit by representative of non - governmental organisation and civil society in general .
we hope that the application of the social agenda will also give citizen the chance to feel part of social europe and to realise that the european union intend to take positive action to continue raise standard of living , rather than merely guarantee minimum level .
the committee on woman & apo ; s right also propose that woman of all age and from all social strata should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection .
we must not forget that woman be always the first to fall prey to economic crisis and the majority of our fellow citizen who be victim of social exclusion and poverty be woman .
in our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society , especially woman & apo ; s organisation in country prepare to join the european family , because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follow in the footstep and adopt the rationale of the rest of europe .
before I give mrs péry the floor , on behalf of the council , I have a few comment to make .
this be mrs péry & apos ; s third visit in succession to parliament , and we welcome this .
that be the first point I want to make .
the only explanation I have for this be that the culprit be always draw back to the scene of the crime .
mrs péry be vice - president for some year , sit in this very chair , and we be always in a very safe pair of hand during difficult vote .
all the more reason why I be delighted to see you here today , mrs péry .
mr president , commissioner , rapporteur , lady and gentleman of the house , let I firstly thank you , mr president , for this personalise introduction .
I be very pleased to be able to join you today for this important debate on the social agenda .
I must also say , however , that elisabeth guigou , the current minister for employment and social affair , would have like to have be able to attend proceeding here today in this institution to which she too once belong and of which she have fond memory , but her new duty require she to be in paris today , and she have therefore ask I to present her apology .
before go any far , I should like to congratulate mrs van lancker , and also the committee on employment and social affair , and its chairman , on the report before we today , which testify to the dynamism and great commitment of the european parliament to the social agenda .
follow the informal employment and social policy council on 8 july this year in paris , the presidency invite all the party involve , the european parliament , of course , the economic and social committee , the committee of the region , both side of industry , ngo , council group and committee , to submit their proposal .
the european parliament resolution on the social agenda which you be just about to adopt be a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise .
the french presidency welcome this text and undertake to give it the utmost consideration in its work .
the informal council meeting of 8 july , the september conference you host with the european commission and mr briet & apos ; s tour of european capital have provide the basis for a number of comment .
let I first make some general remark on the social agenda before cover the various individual area , in a very succinct way , as befit my allotted speaking time .
I be happy to be able to say that all the party involve in social policy declare themselves in favour of draw up an agenda .
this be intend to give a high profile to european social policy and to make it more effective , prepare the european union for the great share challenge ahead .
the agenda be , of course , in keep with the lisbon conclusion and the future european charter of fundamental right , to ensure its effective implementation .
the area of action list in the commission communication be also subject to general agreement .
what debate there be do not involve the type of action to be undertake but rather the method to be adopt in order to achieve the desire objective .
I think we should adopt a pragmatic approach and overcome any misguidedly ideological rift .
as you very rightly suggest in your resolution , thereby support the approach propose by the european commission , we shall continue to use the entire range of community instrument available to we : social dialogue , legislation , coordination , convergence , information exchange and financing under community fund and programme .
it be up to we to determine , area by area and action by action , the instrument well suit to the desire objective .
I now come to my more specific comment , and firstly my comment on employment .
employment be our number one priority , even if the method of tackle the problem be in flux .
here , too , I note unanimity on the need to continue and step up the luxembourg process in the context of the objective establish at the european council in lisbon .
we be particularly commit to the objective of full employment .
it be a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality , and lisbon clearly establish a twofold objective : more job and well job .
it fall to we to define the key element which characterise the quality of employment and then to be capable of measure these .
you will understand , give my duty as a member of the french government , that I be particularly pleased to note that , firstly , the equality of man and woman and , secondly , lifelong training be two area which receive very strong support .
the subject of lifelong training be unanimously adopt as a priority area .
moreover , the two side of industry have undertake to work on this subject .
we must encourage they to do so in order to ensure that initiative by collective agreement be take to promote lifelong training within the short possible time limit .
let I , at this point , remind you that there will be a european seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 december in biarritz , which I shall be chair .
on the subject of the equality of man and woman , many member state stress the need for a well coordination of work and family life , particular with regard to childcare .
this be indeed a key issue , both in order to increase employment rate and in order to make progress towards male - female equality .
to stay on this subject a moment , your resolution provide for many measure in favour of woman and contain one general objective to include the concept of male - female equality in all the sector cover by the agenda .
I support this method .
as you perhaps know , on 27 october , I be hold a ministerial symposium on this subject .
I already speak at length on this subject at your plenary sitting on october 5 .
I shall not therefore remind you of the three area that we shall be debate at this meeting .
you will shortly be discuss the fifth gender equality programme for 2001 - 2006 .
I should like to thank you most sincerely for respond to the presidency & apo ; s invitation by work very quickly and very successfully , enable we to adopt this most important programme , which propose both an integrate approach and specific action , on time .
you can count on I to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of eur 50 million .
finally , in order to step up the integrate approach to equality , the presidency be in favour of implement this concept in a number of meeting of the council of minister .
this be something that will be do under the french presidency .
the social agenda have many more objective .
let I just mention the mobility of worker .
freedom of movement must be encourage , while ensure that career path be safeguard .
I should also like to briefly point out our fight against insecurity and insecure employment . this must be deal with well .
both side of industry point out the need for common definition .
I be think in particular of non - standard work .
plainly , a number of community directive on european work council , transfer and mass redundancy , for example , need to be update .
I also note a strong desire for definition of a genuine community strategy on the working environment , particularly concern health and safety .
exist directive must be simplify and adapt to technical progress , but practical proposal must also be make on emerge risk or dangerous job .
let I say something about social protection .
we all agree that we should pursue the strategy of cooperation in social protection , pay special attention , as we be urge at lisbon , to the issue of pensioner .
at the employment and social policy council hold on 17 october , a great deal of progress be make in the fight against exclusion by define appropriate objective for the fight against poverty and social exclusion , which will serve as a foundation for national action plan .
the agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be give to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resource .
within the next few week , the presidency intend to draw up a general report on all these subject , in the light of the contribution submit to we .
we should be able to successfully complete a document intend for the head of state and government by the time of the employment council on 28 november . this document should express some real ambition for the next five year .
quite clearly , the european parliament will have make a significant contribution , and I thank you for this .
mr president , today we be debate social policy .
I would like to warmly thank mrs van lancker and mrs kratsa for the huge effort they have make in order to set down thought from within parliament on paper .
I would like to make two observation in this regard .
firstly , we use to debate the social action programme , and an action programme imply that something be do .
we be now discuss the social agenda and this could mean that something be do , but not necessarily , and so this be one of the aspect which we need to continually bear in mind .
we be deal with a socialist - inspire council , so chance be that there will be a lot of talk and little action .
I hope I will be prove wrong .
what matter be that something be put on the agenda and that something be do .
this be the aim of this report and we have try to emphasise this in a number of amendment .
today we be discuss social policy , as the rapporteur point out early .
in our group , we have always set great store by the social market economy as a basis for everything we do , also within the framework of the european union .
fortunately , we have largely manage to bring about the common market .
we have also manage to bring about a few thing in the social sphere , but not everything , and this be because the treaty of amsterdam have not take effect at the time ; so , in this light , the social action programme or this social agenda be of particular significance .
we need to try to list and identify the gap leave in the system , and at least put they on the agenda .
the importance of draft an agenda be that we can include item which we hope the commission will develop far .
a number of such point be include .
it would have be very wrong on the part of this parliament not to make any mention of these point , but I be aware that we have not yet solve all the problem relate to these point .
it be thus something which we be pass on to the commission for further examination .
I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe be crucial . in fact , I would also like to refer to the recommendation make by mr cocilovo , which admittedly be not be discuss here but which will be vote on later .
in particular , his recommendation respond to parliament & apos ; s observation on employment .
this be why little mention be make of this in the present report .
however , these two recommendation should actually be see as one entity for the picture to be complete .
I think there be some problem leave unsolved , but these will need to be address in the course of the vote on the amendment .
I would like to congratulate mrs van lancker on produce an excellent report .
I have hear from some quarter that having read the report , they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription .
I take the view that unless we follow this prescription then the prognosis be not good for the state aim of the social agenda , which be to make sure that social policy have a full and equal place alongside employment and economic policy .
this be the prescription we need to follow .
for the socialist group there be many very important point in this report .
for we the open coordination method be very important .
we want to see it strengthen in relation to employment .
we want to see it also apply to social exclusion and social protection .
I be glad to hear what nicole perry have to say to we today in that respect .
open coordination seem to be regard by many as a soft option and I have no doubt that be why it be be support in certain quarter .
it can not be a soft option .
we will insist at every possible opportunity that it have to entail indicator and benchmark and proper peer - group review and that there should be a part for parliament in that procedure .
we also support social dialogue but we insist that the commission should manage that procedure properly and that where negotiation fail we should have an expeditious introduction of legislation where necessary .
paragraph 14 list a number of point we think be important .
I can not go into they all in the time available but let I stress for we the importance of those paragraph relate to the need to update the framework of legislation relate to restructuring .
again I be pleased to hear what nicole perry have say today .
I have not hear similarly encourage thing so far from the commission in relation to , for example , the need to update the european works council directive , or relate to collective redundancy and transfer .
we also , of course , place considerable emphasis upon the general framework relate to information and consultation to make sure that industrial change be manage with social responsibility .
mr president , as far as the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party be concern , it be crucial that the europe of the future should also be a social europe .
the political task be therefore to find the good way of achieve that objective .
for we in the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , it be important that decision should be take as close to the people as possible . this apply especially to labour market and social policy .
at the lisbon summit this spring , the eu & apos ; s head of government adopt a far - sighted vision for the development of a social europe . importance be attach to promote the eu & apos ; s position in the knowledge society , as it be to open coordination in pursuit of common objective , but with flexibility and freedom in the choice of resource .
this be establish as a lead principle .
in its communication , the commission have find a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflect the spirit of the lisbon summit .
in our view , open coordination be the correct route to go down if we be to secure a social europe .
there may be a need for legislation in some area , but we have no need for a host of bureaucratic and constricting rule which bring european cooperation into discredit without produce real result .
I also want to express my appreciation of the major effort which mrs van lancker have put into draw up the report .
her contribution have be very constructive , and if my group be sceptical about a number of the main element in her report , that be because we disagree politically , and that is , of course , understandable .
we do not therefore share the report & apos ; s predilection for legislation at eu level .
there be a number of area in which we feel that too much detail be go into .
I want to emphasise that , in the eu country , we have different tradition and different problem in the area of the labour market and social policy , and the decision of the lisbon summit acknowledge this .
the commission & apos ; s proposal strike a good balance .
technological development and new method of organisation call , of course , for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objective and on achieve result and less upon rigid regulation .
open coordination of this kind be not necessarily devoid of obligation .
of course , it must be bind , but it must be construct from the bottom up and not develop by we specify a host of rule and quota centrally .
specifically , open coordination must be open both in the choice of resource and in the way in which everyone concerned be involve .
it be therefore important that more public interest be create for open coordination and that the latter should be focus on to a great degree , whether it be in employment policy or with regard to the issue of social exclusion which we be now address and to which open coordination can also be apply .
it should not be secretive .
the process should be much well know , and it be here that I think parliament have something to offer .
it can make the process more transparent and give it more public focus .
mr president , first of all , I should like , on behalf of the group of the green / european free alliance , to thank anne van lancker and congratulate she on the quality of her report both in term of its content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it .
the apparently technical term & apos ; social agenda & apos ; in fact cover the day - to - day reality experience by our fellow citizen .
we must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what have be call the notorious european & apos ; social model & apos ; .
we have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectation of all the citizen and the collective movement they have form , which be the group most motivated to establish a european union which be a community of citizen .
the issue to be discuss select themselves : we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declaration make at the lisbon summit .
we must give the people of europe the tool and the public policy they need in order to fashion their own place within europe , in order to ensure that their fundamental right , include social right , be safeguard .
the urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the european social model call for initiative that aim to establish right : the right to an income , the right to a wage , the right to decent pension for all within the european union .
implement the ambition for society declare in lisbon call for an effort on the part of the community , an action plan to create job in service , especially those relate to the information society .
as far as that be concern , the directive propose in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new form of working be essential .
it be also important to ensure quality in health , an improved social situation , and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measure be essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerge economy of solidarity .
we support anne van lancker and mrs péry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the european works council directive .
the fundamental notion of the general interest ought , moreover , to spur we all to approve the proposal to include recital relate to employment in the regulation and decision on the merger currently dictate by consideration of competitiveness .
these three example intend to combat poverty , support the development of activity for job creation , social liaison and quality of life , and to improve employee & apo ; right , should harness the support of a parliament that be anxious to propagate the dream of a europe of the citizen , although these same citizen currently all too often feel that europe be a machine commercialise all human activity .
a number of amendment betray the terror of some of our fellow member who get their eraser out as soon as they see the word & apo ; legislation & apos ; .
be they go to go and explain to the people of europe that parliament deem it necessary to vote through directive to protect investment and liberalise general interest service , but not to define and regulate what have be describe here as the labour market ?
such a rejection of legislation , moreover , lead to a plain rejection of negotiation . we even have one amendment that go as far as propose to eliminate the objective of conclude european collective agreement between the two side of industry .
it be in this area that we can , in our opinion , find the kind of old - fashioned idea attribute to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market .
mr president , there really be a need for a social agenda in europe after many year of neo - liberal economic policy which have lead to unemployment and social exclusion everywhere , include in my own affluent country , sweden .
begging have return to our large town after having disappear from they as long ago as the immediate post - war year .
even the private charitable organisation and their soup kitchen appear to be need again .
I must therefore welcome the purpose of the commission & apos ; s work and of mrs van lancker & apos ; s report .
many of her proposal be extremely commendable and deserve our full support .
genuine social initiative cost a lot of money , a factor which I think be discuss far too little in the report .
these resource must come mainly from the member state . it be therefore the social authority in each country upon whom demand must essentially be make .
government must set aside more resource , more social worker must be appoint and more resource must be give to the voluntary social organisation . otherwise , the result will be fine word without any practical content .
mrs van lancker & apos ; s report present the commission and its legislation as the real engine of social work .
I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it be a question of provide aid at a problem level .
the commission can obviously make an important contribution , but the social problem have their root in local condition and must be handle with great sensitivity for the practical condition concern .
the commission can help set a high standard , but it be social worker , the union and voluntary activist we must pin our hope on , and not official in brussels .
finally , I would just add that I be not a co - author of amendment no 35 as state in the document with the amendment .
on the contrary , I be very critical of the amendment .
the name figueiredo should be there instead of my own name .
the secretariat must have make a mistake , and I would ask for this to be correct .
mr president , I welcome the publication this year of the new european union social policy agenda for the year 2000 - 2005 .
this receive fresh impetus at the lisbon european council meeting of the european union leader early this year .
key priority in this agenda include the follow : an increase role will be give to the social partner in term of draft eu directive and regulation .
employee relation will be improve .
there will be continue european union support for local job creation programme .
new eu mechanism for mediation , arbitration and conciliation will be draft .
a new eu charter for small business will be put in place .
there will be improve coordination of policy programme in the area of the information society .
and there will be a modernising of telecommunications service and internet - relate activity .
from an irish perspective I would like to say to the member of the house that one of the reason why there have be such strong economic progress in our country be the fact that we have have a system of social partnership in place since 1987 .
this have mean that the government have work closely with the trade union and employee group on a whole range of economic and social activity in an effort to secure broad agreement in matter such as pay and condition for employee in ireland .
this have certainly help to reduce industrial unrest in our country and have contribute to increase inward investment programme from abroad .
I would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunications service .
the european union must take advantage of the new and evolve technology which be come on stream at this time .
I welcome the publication of the new framework programme of telecommunications regulation and directive which be publish in july of this year by the commission .
parliament be presently deliberate on seven different telecommunications regulation and be due to give an opinion on these matter before christmas .
as regard e - commerce , it be fair to say that the united states of america have a head start on the european union .
however , the european union be catch up fast and the implementation of a broad range of telecommunication directive and regulation would certainly assist in this process .
finally , I would like to commend the commissioner for consumer protection , mr byrne , for his effort in try to secure an agreement on how good to move forward on regulate a vast structure for e - commerce transaction now and for the future .
mr president , for almost half a century european integration have be base on the economy .
indeed we speak of a european economic community .
the priority be give to set up a common market , with the principle of the free movement of property , good and capital , the establishment of rule govern competition between firm and state aid .
social policy serve to mitigate the most damaging effect of economic policy .
the provision enshrine in the treaty of rome be confine to the principle of equal pay for man and woman ( article 141 ) and the freedom of movement of worker .
the commission communication and mrs van lancker & apos ; s report have the merit of remedy this imbalance by acknowledge the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy .
mrs van lancker & apos ; s report be an ambitious one . the rapporteur effectively ask the commission to intensify the agenda , chiefly in the follow area : employment , with the framing of a european pact for employment and social cohesion , as concern lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross - border testing of social and fiscal legislation .
next , in the area of social dialogue , this intensification would be express by adopt a directive on employee information and consultation , and the european works council directive , with a revision of the directive on redundancy .
finally , in the area of social protection , it would take the form of pursue a strategy of convergence .
it be a veritable catalogue of measure which be more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implement in the medium term .
in conclusion , the objective of give new impetus to european social policy in the face of globalisation , enlargement and an age population be a laudable one .
it demonstrate that economic competitiveness and social cohesion be not mutually exclusive .
the method use , on the other hand , seem more debatable .
regard the financing of ngo and their participation in community policy , there be still no legal basis in the treaty , paragraph 13 .
similarly , with the new social agenda , there be a desire to pass legislation at community level , at the risk of harmonise to minimum standard and short - circuit social relation within the member state .
before we continue with the agenda , there be something I would like to say .
due to the fact that we have waste another 40 minute today on a debate about the rule of procedure , we be now hopelessly behind schedule .
I must therefore ask you to stick religiously to your speak time , so as to ensure that the sitting now proceed in an orderly manner .
can you please discuss within your respective group whether it be constructive to have forty minute of moan and groan at the beginning of every sitting , before get down to business .
the only people that suffer be you , who want to engage in political debate .
mr president , if the rapporteur will allow I I will start by say where I agree with she and - if the rapporteur will forgive I - that may not take long .
of course , colleague and I share her ideal for a well standard of live for all the people of europe , for a well quality of life and for promotion of social inclusion .
where I part company be on her proposal or - as stephen hughes say - her prescription to secure that end , because her proposal will lead we far away from those ideal rather than towards achievement .
various speaker have talk about the lisbon summit today . that be hail six month ago as a very important summit .
mention be make there of a new direction for europe : move away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980 towards enterprise , innovation , competition and employment .
however , the report say something slightly different : whereas lisbon call for a reform of the social model , it call for reinforcement ; whereas lisbon call for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility , the report propose four new or amend directive and a number of legislative initiative .
the report set out the standard socialist solution throughout the age of legislation , legislation , legislation .
what we need to pursue our common goal be not more regulation , but less .
we do not want more burdening of business , we want less .
we do not want more unemployment , we want less .
the original commission proposal be much well leave unamended - congratulation commissioner .
I propose that we leave it unamende and we reject the report , otherwise we will give the clear possible signal that parliament be continue to pursue the old agenda .
surely it be time to move on .
mr president , the commission have table a very ambitious proposal , and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the commissioner for combine great understanding of national difference with considerable determination , without which this would never have be anything other than a pretty piece of paper .
I should also like to thank the other anna for the substantial work she have do on this matter , something we could not have do without .
the debate today and in the committee show that there be major political difference and major difference in ambition in this area , and I think it good that these difference should be clearly bring out .
in this way , people have a clear choice when they vote at the next parliamentary election : a choice between those who want to see a social europe and those who merely want the eu to regulate the internal market . a choice between right and leave .
our fellow mep from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party and , in particular , from the british conservative party , have re - table a series of amendment which would genuinely weaken the ambition of this social action programme .
every time legislation be propose , these thatcher - inspire neo - liberal embark upon an ideological crusade .
europe do not deserve dogmatism , however .
what europe need be for we to assess pragmatically what regulatory tool will be the most effective in the practical situation .
in some case , we need the open coordination method .
on other occasion , it be well for the two side of industry to negotiate their way towards an agreement .
we must not , however , be afraid to use legislation if this be what be require for we to achieve our objective .
I also want to raise another practical issue which this strategy have focus upon .
this be the need to come up with a definite strategy for the working environment which would give we the opportunity to devise a coherent policy in this area .
within the area of the working environment , too , we must make a practical assessment of which tool be good for solve the various problem .
here , too , dogmatism be not the way forward but , rather , find pragmatic solution to real problem .
mr president , lady and gentleman , I feel that the lisbon summit have present we with a picture of a future europe which can not , which must not be purely an economic europe , but which must be a genuine political entity .
and in order to be a political entity , europe must have a cultural and social , as well as economic structure .
in my opinion , therefore , the proposal present by the commission on the social agenda be extremely positive .
however , I do agree with almost all of mrs van lancker & apos ; s report - and for this I be grateful to she - for I do not believe that when mrs van lancker make a specific reference to clear objective , proposal for specific instrument and , in particular , precise deadline , that she be revert to the socialist logic of old , as somebody have suggest today .
it be rather that she be simply revert to a longstanding need , the need for cohesion in a situation which , from this point of view , be become increasingly difficult to regulate because it lack any form of harmonisation .
in discuss a charter of fundamental right and advocate a european constitution we can not shy away from certain issue : we have to insist that all the necessary measure must be take , even if this mean produce more accurate legislation .
I do not believe that mrs van lancker intend to create law to regulate absolutely everything ; I feel rather that she consider it necessary , when coordinate action do not produce the desire result , when the citizen encounter inequality between the state and when there be no social harmonisation , to bring about this harmonisation .
the issue of open coordination must therefore be tackle alongside a comprehensive action to develop social legal basis , for without they we will not be able to persuade the state to harmonise a social policy which uphold equality and equal opportunity .
mr president , now that we have have a return to growth , it be crucial for the european union to provide itself with the mean to meet expectation in the social sector .
the commission communication highlight a raft of ambitious objective , such as full employment , equal opportunity , training , etc . , but there be many contradiction between the european union & apos ; s declare ambition and its political decision .
among other aspect , let I cite the concern for productivity , which generally involve wage moderation as a priority .
I would therefore like to join my fellow member in congratulate anne van lancker on her report , which open up new perspective , with an approach which aim for great precision and great coherence .
her report appreciably build on the commission & apos ; s proposal by suggest the harmonisation of social regulation and the coordination of national social legislation .
it call for a genuine european agreement to be frame in favour of employment and social cohesion and propose initiative on the gradual reduction of work time prior to retirement , the introduction of a minimum wage and cross - border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law .
this be all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intention and actually take practical action .
this , I feel , be part of the consistent approach which we be lack .
I be pleased to see , furthermore , that mrs van lancker have include a number of amendment table by my group , particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporate the right to strike into community legislation .
together with my group , I have table some amendment criticise the commission & apos ; s approach call for the adoption of wage restraint .
I advocate the reduction of working time without a concomitant reduction in salary .
having say that , I support anne van lancker & apos ; s report , which have the great merit of adopt an ambitious social policy back up by specific objective which go beyond the usual purely formal declaration .
mr president , I would like to congratulate mrs van lancker , who have supplement the commission & apos;s already excellent report with amendment table by myself .
naturally , I be very pleased about this : it be just a pity that the amendment which be most important in my opinion have not be include .
I listen with pleasure to mrs péry & apos ; s brief summary of the council & apos ; s social policy , which I firmly support .
I be very familiar with the project and support all the work carry out by commissioner anna diamantopoulou to date . she will remember that I ask she , one day , whether her attitude to pensioner & apo ; issue be that of a fairy godmother or a wicked stepmother .
mr president , lady and gentleman , there be two people here today who deserve special congratulation , one be anna lancker , for her outstanding report , and the other be anna diamantopoulou , for her outstanding submission .
it be an ambitious agenda , and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that be make during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection .
the council be not even prepare to discuss the matter at the time .
what be clearly new be that we have adopt an employment policy , base on the lisbon decision , indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature .
we do not want over - regulation - and I say this to the british delegate who speak before - but the diversity of modern contract of employment require new form of social protection , and not the rule of the nineteenth century .
we also stand to gain a great deal from have a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy , and , not least , from develop the social economy and the service sector .
what be not so new , and the subject of repeat demand , be lifelong learning - which be something even the small member state have do something about - as be the long overdue reform to the european factory committee law , the legal protection of nursing and expectant mother , and freedom of movement .
I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiative produce in response to the new challenge we face in health and safety at work , employee participation and labour relation .
of course , I be delighted to see the french presidency show such commitment to the issue of childcare , family and woman & apo ; s policy .
perhaps it have something to do with the fact that all three people responsible - in the commission , parliament and the council - be woman .
but what we need now , in tandem with this , be instrument that allow for the involvement of father .
that would be a new departure .
besides , this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate country , and I therefore wish it every success .
the council must not leave various specific proposal that have be postpone year after year simply hang in the air .
as the rapporteur , mrs van lancker , emphasise , although social dialogue be important , it must produce tangible result .
otherwise , the commission will have to propose legislative instrument and the council will have to approve the measure need , specifically by amend macroeconomic policy and the stability pact , in order to give credibility to our fight against poverty and social exclusion and to our effort to defend good quality job with respectable salary and to advocate reform that give employee dignity .
mr president , I think that the social policy agenda be positive for everyone .
I think that harmonise the social policy of the different member state can not do anything other than benefit all european . it will be particularly beneficial in all aspect relate to employment , which , since the lisbon summit , we know be a priority for the whole of the european union .
I would like to particularly stress the benefit which , in term of employment , can be obtain by woman through give they improve access to employment with guarantee in term of work time and salary .
I think that there be also a great advantage , if we succeed in get the directive apply , modify and update , with regard to maternity leave : for woman to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protect when woman have to continue work during that period .
I also think that it will be very positive in term of help woman to reconcile family and work life .
it be go to enable woman to continue in their job without neglect their family obligation .
neither can we forget what the e - europe initiative mean for new job , new technology and the information society , where I think woman have an important role to play .
these be new job where people can work from home with regulation that help to reconcile work life with family life .
all these coordinate social policy action will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion .
I think that we should all welcome the arrival of this social policy agenda .
mr president , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the commissioner and mrs péry on this presentation of the social agenda .
I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identify instrument , sector of intervention and timeframe and guarantee positive , dynamic interaction between economic , social and employment policy .
these instrument be intend to adapt the european social model in line with the change reality .
I fully support mrs van lancker & apos;s report and I would like , in particular , to stress a point which have , moreover , already be raise by both the rapporteur and mrs péry in their speech , and that be the need for all the instrument to be genuinely implement at european level , and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension .
this be what happen in many country .
in conclusion , I would like to give an example : last week , the italian parliament adopt a new law on welfare which be propose by a minister - a woman , like the three representative of the three institution . this be tantamount to a revolution , for the old law on welfare have be in force for over 100 year .
mr president , the commission draft on the socio - political agenda contain many positive concept such as full employment , quality of work , social quality and modernisation of social protection .
but it lack substance to some extent .
mrs van lancker & apos ; s outstanding report make good the deficiency of the commission draft as regard content .
we support a pact for employment and social cohesion , a european action plan for employment with a view to boost the social economy and local employment initiative , social regulation for new form of work such as tele - work and new form of self - employment , the minimum wage , and guarantee income .
the european union have already stand idly by for far too long , watch poverty and social exclusion take hold in the member state .
indeed mrs van lancker & apos ; s proposal for improve the information available to , and participation of , female employee , and for social clause in public contract , merger and international agreement , be long overdue .
we object to the fact that the commission and the council be unwilling to make additional resource available for the social agenda .
social quality can not be achieve free and gratis .
it sometimes seem to I that the concept of modernisation be often tantamount to the undermining of social protection .
extend people & apos ; s work life be not modernisation , no more so be fund pension by freeze or lower the statutory pension level , and advise people to take up investment opportunity on the financial market .
we need modern , european social harmonisation , not deregulation .
mr president , I have one minute and three point to make . firstly , I should like to thank mrs van lancker on the work she have do in produce this excellent report .
as for my second point , I wish to restate my group & apos ; s fundamental conviction .
the work area open up in the social agenda must be give a coherent , and certainly conciliatory , legal framework : the policy of convergence and the policy of coordination which have be initiate , and also support by legislative measure , when necessary , which in turn should be reinforce by genuinely stringent monitoring method .
as for my third point , there be some right that have simply be gloss over from the viewpoint of a social europe : the right to a minimum income , the information and consultation of employee , the european collective agreement .
these be point which , we know , be contest by the conservative in europe , but to which we , in our group , attach great importance .
minister , commissioner , we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issue .
I hope , minister , that in nice the french presidency will succeed in push through an ambitious social agenda , since embark on the construction of a social europe be still the great hope of all our fellow citizen .
mr president , I should like to extend my special thank both to the rapporteur , mrs van lancker , and the french presidency for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoy to date .
I shall try very briefly to pinpoint a few political aspect of the four area touch on in great or less detail by all the speaker , i.e. the new political approach in the social agenda , secondly the content , thirdly the mean and fourthly the procedure .
as far as the political approach be concern , we need , I think , to highlight two new element .
the first be that , since lisbon , the new approach to social policy be to deal with it not as a product or by - product of economic policy , but as a policy in its own right which need to be exercise in tandem with economic policy and the employment strategy .
in other word , this be the only way for we to deal with europe & apos ; s objective of competitiveness , give our constant concern for enterprise and the economy , and social cohesion , give our constant concern for our citizen and their welfare .
the second element in the new approach be quality . quality as a new political concept to deal with working condition , employment relation and the service of the social state .
these two political approach underpin the entire content .
what be the basic strand which make up the content ?
there be three .
a set of project and proposal on employment .
the second strand to the social agenda be a set of project on social policy .
here I would like to refer to the proposal for combat poverty and exclusion , the new work which we have start on pension and social protection , policy for people with special need and , more importantly , I would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect , i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy .
we must not simply calculate the cost of social policy , which be often see from several political angle as an obstacle to economic development ; we must calculate the cost of not implement social policy .
I think that this analysis will give we new , interesting result and approach .
the third strand in the content be enlargement .
to be brief , social policy , the new social standard and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate country with the member state be one of the most important feature of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that .
this bring I to the third area which have engage our attention today and throughout our cooperation : the mean .
I think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation , i.e. do we or do we not need legislation , be old hat .
clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in europe , but change on the job market , change in the economy , change in the environment due to globalisation and the information society be throw up new requirement .
when we need to deal with these new requirement with legislation , we shall not , of course , have any hesitation in do so .
if we can deal with they in other way and with other method , we shall do so .
the proposal for a scoreboard , for a specific method for monitor the social agenda , be a huge challenge .
the problem be that , because of the legal basis which it have in the treaty , the social agenda do not constitute a set of law , a set of directive with specific step for the member state .
it be still hard for we to define european objective which be equally valid for all the member state because the situation on the ground vary .
we therefore believe that , in the first instance , common european indicator , a project which be now near completion , and national objective , i.e. the need for each country to have its own scoreboard and carry out monitoring , be a step along the road to provide we with specific result .
and one last comment : the question of sexual equality run right through the social agenda as regard both the political approach and the content and mean .
thank you , commissioner , for your interesting speech .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12.30 p.m .
community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001 - 2005 )
the next item be the report ( a5 - 0294 / 2000 ) table by mrs eriksson , on behalf of the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity , on the proposal for a council decision on the programme relate to the community framework strategy on gender equality ( 2001 - 2005 ) & # 91 ; com ( 2000 ) 335 - c5 - 0386 / 2000 - 2000 / 0143 ( cns ) & # 93 ; .
mr president , commissioner , minister , lady and gentleman , I be very pleased to see you all here .
the commission & apos ; s communication affirm that democracy be a fundamental value of the eu member state , the eea state and the candidate country , as well as a key part of external relation and development cooperation in the union .
it also affirm that real democracy require all citizen , woman and man alike , to participate and be represent equally in the economy , decision making and social , cultural and civil life .
there be major deficiency in all these area . the commission therefore propose to tackle the problem with a combination of measure .
in tandem with integrate equality perspective into all policy area - what be normally call gender mainstreaming - specific measure for woman will be implement .
I fully endorse that strategy and approach and consider that it be not an exaggeration to say that no effort to promote gender equality be of last value unless woman & apo ; s right be strengthen at the same time .
this work have go quite quickly despite the fact that it take a little time at the beginning .
the committee have submit 49 amendment .
at the beginning we have 126 , which indicate that we be incredibly committed .
I be very pleased about this .
we believe , for example , that it be very important for the commission to guarantee maximum openness around this programme so that all interested party can keep abreast of proceeding throughout the implementation phase .
it be also incredibly important , not to say fundamental , that the various community action , the framework strategy and the member state & apos ; measure complement , and do not counteract , each other .
this be , of course , also the commission & apos ; s and the council & apos ; s express ambition .
the commission have now identify five focus area of strategic importance .
I have no objection in this respect , nor have the committee .
we have come up with a new shock proposal , which be really a reiteration of what be state in our opinion on the budget .
we believe that 40 per cent of the structural fund should be earmark to focus on woman & apo ; s condition and need .
the commission & apos ; s propose measure should be expand to include review of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pension , an analysis of shortcoming in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in work hour .
what we have just recently discuss here in this chamber be , of course , the social issue , and I wish once again to emphasise the repeat observation that over 50 million eu citizen be , in fact , classify as poor and that a large majority of those be woman .
this be , of course , something which need not only to be observe but also to be combat , and with the help of vigorous measure .
we have have a lot of detailed discussion of various assessment procedure .
I shall not go into any more detail here . rather , I just want to mention it .
we have touch upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non - governmental organisation .
discussion have be hold as to how the candidate country can be incorporate in the programme in a natural way .
we have also discuss what we must do in order not only to give a mention to woman in the develop country but also to be able to do something practical in this area .
during the final phase of the journey , I have be in very close contact with people in both the commission and the council .
we naturally want to include the strategy in the council decision , too .
what we mean in the committee by strategy be , of course , not the commission & apos ; s open gambit , but that strategy begin as from paragraph 2 ( & apos ; the strategy & apo ; ) .
I be say this so that no mysterious or technical procedure cause this to be misunderstood , for no less than seven different amendment in the same spirit have be table .
in other word , the council too must adopt the commission & apos ; s strategy .
it be therefore important that non - governmental organisation should obtain influence in the course of implementation .
one amendment be to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in parliament , together with the commission .
this perhaps affect only the commission and parliament , but I be very grateful indeed for the fact that you , mrs diamantopoulou and you , mrs péry be here , and I be very much look forward to hear your point of view on all the amendment .
commissioner , we wait with a great deal of anticipation for the commission & apos ; s communication on the strategy which it intend to apply to gender equality over the next five year .
unfortunately , the time available to we in committee do not give we a chance to process either the communication or mrs eriksson & apos ; s report although , having say that , we do make every possible effort to respond to the objective set by the european commission .
at the same time , we must stress the need for complementarity between the measure and main line of approach in the area of economic life , equal participation and representation , social right , the civil society and the role and stereotype of the two sex .
woman will then feel close to europe and europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative idea which will be formulate as a result of their connection with this programme .
we think it be extremely important to promote a positive image of woman and visibility of their work and importance .
we think that these project will help woman gain self - confidence in their role .
finally , we trust , as be say during the previous plenary when we debate old parliamentary report , that we will have an evaluation procedure of substance and consistency .
mr president , commissioner , we have have the fourth framework programme , and today we be discuss the fifth .
the present report by the commission and parliament show that despite the fact that there have be a number of success over the past few year , the list of unfinished or unsatisfactory point be too long .
therefore it be still our goal for the next five year to consolidate the position of woman in the policy of all member state , both in term of quality and content .
as far as the strategic goal be concern , for example , in the sphere of & apo ; woman in work life & apo ; , economic and employment policy issue can not be deal with separately from issue of social responsibility , social security , and a fair distribution of caring responsibility .
problem to do with access to social security must be look at on a case - by - case basis to this end .
furthermore , the community must do more in the way of assess the need for additional initiative , include , where necessary , implement legislation and equal opportunity , and fight discrimination .
the european parliament , the national parliament and network must therefore become more closely involved .
financial resource be indispensable , as be always the case when goal be to be achieve and there be a great deal of catch up to do .
this programme be therefore conditional on fund total eur 50 million be make available for the period from 2001 to 2005 .
this mean that we must step up our effort to achieve a woman & apo ; s policy that cross the institutional and political divide , and to enable the equal opportunity strategy call for to be implement more effectively .
we must invest our energy in the realisation and implementation of the plan programme , and this must go hand in hand with well - time evaluation and coordination with other programme .
we expect to receive an annual report from the president of the commission , within the context of an annual debate in the european parliament .
it be also necessary to establish a council of minister both in order to deal with the content of the work , and with a view to win recognition for woman & apo ; s policy .
make woman & apo ; s policy an adjunct to other political theme do not do the matter justice .
woman & apo ; s policy must also be a criterion use to assess whether the candidate country be ready for accession .
the european parliament could lead the way here by set a well example .
I hope that the sixth framework programme will not need to be as comprehensive as the present one .
for this to be the case , woman & apo ; s policy will have to be take more seriously over the next five year and not just include in all political , economic and social programme , but actually implement .
woman & apo ; s policy be not - as happen so often - to be incorporate into programme for minority .
at 52 % , woman be not a minority group !
I would like to congratulate mrs eriksson on an excellent report and the commission on an excellent strategy for gender equality .
it encompass all those area where action be need and , if successfully coordinate , could make a real difference to woman in all aspect of their everyday life .
this could work if the framework strategy be an integral part of the programme , as an annex to it .
this would ensure the implementation of the programme and I therefore support the comment make by the rapporteur early on .
there have not be a shortage of good idea or good plan to achieve equality in the past but their implementation have often fail .
this time the commission be put forward a new approach .
it be very welcome but it be only valuable if it can actually be make to work .
that mean also reach woman in their own community .
the involvement of local and regional authority in this process be invaluable .
they be the large employer across the member state and the central provider of education , training and economic development and , as such , they be key player in achieve equality .
I hope due regard will be pay to they in the final programme .
mr president , lady and gentleman , no one be dispute that we should strive for great equity between man and woman .
for too long , woman & apo ; s role have be despise .
in this respect , the napoleonic code , which be frame in france at the beginning of the 19th century and export to every corner of europe , must shoulder a large share of the blame .
woman must once again be give a place that be in keep with the vital importance of their vocation , and I be not entirely sure that mrs eriksson & apos ; s report make any contribution towards this .
all the same , the text before we be not entirely lacking in quality .
so , amendment no 2 , present by my own committee , grant single father the same right as single mother . equality and fair treatment must work both way , that be the ideal .
I be delighted , moreover , that improvement in childcare facility be plan in order to well support the reconciliation of professional and family life .
this report do , however , give some cause for concern .
amendment no 18 , for example , which seek to support action by candidate country to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on they social choice alien to their culture .
in this respect , in new york , very distinct difference between the european union and poland emerge .
by fail to respect poland & apos ; s social choice , the european union would be take a very peculiar , and very disturbing , view of pluralism .
furthermore , amendment no 19 on establish an audit of equal opportunity within the public budget be extremely debatable .
indeed , the way the concept of discrimination have be manipulate make it , in many respect , an empty formula use by a whole collection of sorcerer & apos ; s apprentice in order to achieve their ideological end .
it be high time we break with an ideological vision of woman & apos ; s place in society .
in this area , as in many other , it be essential for public authority to exercise true pluralism in select their associate .
it be not right for a handful of woman , expert in make claim of society and live on intravenous injection of public monie , to monopolise the role of speak on behalf of woman .
in this respect , I can not but endorse the decision by the committee on budget to break the monopoly hold for so long by the european woman & apo ; s lobby .
I should like to see this house confirm this bold change of course .
a decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliance which too closely bind a number of pressure group to the european commission and to some political group in this house .
the woman & apo ; s movement can only be strengthen by such a decision .
I could go even far , and say it would be ennoble by such a decision .
this be something my group will take into consideration in its final vote .
( applause from the uen group )
mr president , we be aware of the progress that have be make in recent year with regard to the situation of woman , particularly the legislative progress , but there be still situation of real inequality in everyday life .
the low level of representation of woman in political and economic sphere and gender - relate violence be two clear sign that structural discrimination against woman be continue .
this programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concern , need and aspiration of woman be take into account in all policy .
the current situation require that positive action measure in favour of woman be implement .
the objective that the programme set out in five specific area will help to ensure that all the action take will be associate with at least one of those area .
participation in economic life , which woman should enjoy under equal condition to man , employment , which be the basis for all equality and integration , and achieve the 60 % target propose at the lisbon summit , would also solve other problem .
the inclusion of this objective in all community programme , within the framework of the structural fund , should be effect in accordance with community legislation .
equality in participation and representation , balance in the decision - make process , great participation in political life , whatever the process adopt , in order to achieve an increase in the participation of woman , until we reach the 40 % figure propose by the commission .
equal access and full enjoyment of social right for woman and man , which would mean ensure that the legislation be apply in the social sphere in term of maternity leave , maternity protection , work time , employment contract , etc .
equality between woman and man in civil life , allow woman to fully enjoy human right and fundamental freedom .
we especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in woman and domestic violence .
we need to encourage a change in the role and stereotype associate with gender , which will also help to solve some of the other problem above .
in relation to this objective we will support the organisation of awareness campaign and a european equality week in cooperation with the member state , as the commission propose .
we think that it be very useful to create a web site , not only due to the increase use of computerised medium , but because this will help woman to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be exclude .
something that we think be of particular importance be the evaluation of the programme ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , lady and gentleman , I believe we be now discuss commissioner diamantopoulou & apos ; s second tour de force .
with the framework strategy and the new action programme in place , the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity - work under intense time pressure , and restrict to only a few official language - have now , with a great deal of good will , introduce 60 propose amendment .
I hope that the president - in - office of the council , nicole péry , will be able to get through the programme in the council in november .
I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme , when the erstwhile federal government under helmut kohl halve the budget , no less .
time be press .
woman be still not adequately represent in politic and in economic decision - make process .
accord to eurostat , approximately 77 % of the recipient of low wage be woman .
depend on the country and sector , woman earn up to 30 % less than their male counterpart .
the framework strategy must be bring to bear in this regard as well .
all the equal opportunity initiative should be coordinate under one roof and translate into the five , specific , strategic goal .
other speaker have make the same point .
that would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept .
I be expect the male protagonist to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherit notion of gender role and stereotype .
we also want to see the lead politician on our side , and call upon president prodi , the council , and the minister , to take full account of the gender aspect , for example in the context of the european union & apos ; s foreign relation , and particularly where the enlargement process be concern .
more emphasis should be place on establish link between woman & apo ; s organisation , which be something I call for back when I be rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme .
our parliamentary committee plan to stage a conference on this specialist policy area , together with the parliamentary committee of our member state and of the candidate country , in november in berlin .
I be hope that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy .
this be where europe will again lead the way in the fight for woman & apo ; s right in europe .
mr president , follow the first four action programme for equality between woman and man , it be a good move on the part of the commission to innovate by propose a community framework strategy for equality and a programme to implement this strategy and make real progress towards equality .
there be great need of this , even though a quarter of a century have pass since the first community directive on the equal treatment of man and woman with regard to pay .
I find the commission & apos ; s new approach to be a very positive one , and the proposal for a decision for the 2001 - 2005 programme to have be well consider .
unfortunately , the report by the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity be no improvement on the text put forward by the commission .
it overegg the pudding , and include unconsidered and indigestible proposal , word in such a way as to make a first - year law student & apos ; s hair stand on end .
in committee , I have table a raft of amendment intend to do away with the bad of the incongruity , particularly those that demonstrate an outlandish mish - mash of strategy and programme .
the commission have produce an excellent text .
it be a very serious mistake , in politic , to mix strategy up with tactic or with programme .
as be so often the case in report by the committee on woman & apo ; s right and equal opportunity , we have here a report include the ideological claim of the left wing coalition , the gauche plurielle , in this parliament , like the claim that measure eligible for programme funding in a transnational context should include the analysis and assessment of , I quote , & quot ; the significance of a general reduction in work hour & quot ; .
do we really need to waste any of the paltry eur 53.45 million in appropriation to cover five year on such an analysis ?
I think not .
I be also of the opinion that the appropriation for the european woman & apo ; s lobby , budget line a 3037 , should not be include in the appropriation commit for the programme and I hope that the commissioner will favour the amendment that I and the other member of my group have table , above the rapporteur & apos ; s own far - fetched amendment .
mr president , I think it would be a great shame if nicole péry be not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she be here , so that we might hear her point of view , too .
mrs eriksson , mrs péry have not ask to speak and I can not force she to . I can not order the president - in - office of the council to take the floor .
in any case , I feel that we should thank she for follow the debate , especially since she be not schedule to be present during this discussion as well .
however , I see that she be prepare to leave now .
mr president , I should like to thank and congratulate mrs eriksson , who have endeavour in the short time available to respond to the need for we to accept the programme as quickly as possible , so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programme and can start implement the fifth programme in january .
this programme be an important document for the committee on woman & apo ; s right , which be why it provoke a great deal of interest and , of course , it form part of the more overall strategy which be discuss with the committee on woman & apo ; s right , the committee on social affair and the council .
it be the familiar 5 - pronged strategy of participation of woman in economic life , at the decision - make centre , in social policy , in civil society and in human right , together with the new model of gender equality for the mass medium and education .
our cooperation with the committee be excellent , which be why we can accept a large number of amendment , either to the letter or in spirit .
specifically , we accept amendment nos 2 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 28 , 32 , 43 , 46 , 48 , 49 , 51 , 55 , 56 and 59 .
we be also able to accept part of amendment nos 3 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 27 , 35 , 37 , 45 , 50 , 53 , 57 and 58 .
I think that the large number of amendment accept be illustrative of the meeting of mind between the commission and the committee on woman & apo ; s right .
I should like to make two comment on the amendment which we be unable to accept , mainly for technical and legal reason rather than because of a difference of approach .
first , as far as the strategy be concern .
it be not possible for the entire strategy to form part of the council decision , but I agree that some amendment could be make to the wording of the article in order to make it perfectly clear that this strategy have be take into account and form the basis on which the programme will be implement .
secondly , as far as the specific percentage to be earmark from the structural fund be concerned .
I should remind you that a regulation be vote through last year which clearly set out how item be allocate and we can not use a programme to change the regulation which already exist .
I must stress that we absolutely agree on the need to focus on complementarity between current action and programme and , of course , on the important role which non - governmental organisation must play in design and implement these programme .
major european woman & apo ; s organisation therefore clearly have access to all the programme .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
competition policy
the next item be the joint debate on the two report table on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affair and industrial policy :
( a5 - 0290 / 2000 ) table by mrs riis - jørgensen , on the xxixth report on competition policy - 1999 & # 91 ; sec ( 2000 ) 720 - c5 - 0302 / 2000 - 2000 / 2153 ( cos ) & # 93 ; ;
( a5 - 0281 / 2000 ) table by mr evans , on the commission & apos;s eighth survey on state aid in the european union & # 91 ; com ( 2000 ) 205 - c5 - 0430 / 2000 - 2000 / 2211 ( cos ) & # 93 ; .
mr president , I very much welcome the commission & apos ; s report .
it be a splendid piece of work that commissioner monti and his staff carry out last year .
in my report on the twenty - ninth report on the commission & apos ; s competition policy , I expend particular energy on the problem concern merger and the repayment of state aid .
I do this for a number of reason .
firstly because , in the course of last year , I be approach on a number of occasion by company which have feel a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with ruling on merger , especially in relation to those case in which they have need to appeal to the court of first instance against the commission & apos ; s rule .
with regard to state aid , moreover , problem apparently still exist with ensure that unlawfully pay state aid be pay back to the national exchequer .
let we begin , however , with merger . one consequence of emu be , of course , that we see more and more merger .
I also think the time be ripe for re - assess whether the procedure and set of rule we have at present be as good as they could be .
the world be not , of course , always so easy for those who have to follow the rule and procedure we be involve in devising .
I think it be necessary for clear rule to be devise for what be call the relevant market .
it be important to distinguish between what may be call the peripheral area of europe and what may be call the heart of europe .
it be especially important to put this distinction in place before enlargement , for it can be difficult for the small country in the peripheral area when company wish to merge , because the latter quickly become large player in their own market .
it be not especially appropriate that large company in small country should be prevent from merge for , in that way , their opportunity to compete globally be reduce .
I should therefore like to remind you that we do , of course , have exist rule to take care of those circumstance in which company exploit their important and possibly dominant market position .
we therefore need not perhaps be so afraid of merger .
after all , it be not a crime for company to merge .
another thing I feel very strongly about be the need to arrange for merger to go through more quickly .
I be think here , in particular , of those circumstance in which a company wish to appeal against the commission & apos ; s rule .
quite simply , a period of between 25 and 35 month be too long in our global village for get a case through the court , and what be very time consume be have the document of the case translate .
that be not good enough .
we owe it to our company to offer they the good condition so that they be able to plan their production and , especially , their future .
on the subject of merger , I have two question for you , commissioner monti .
would it be possible to consider different possible solution for separate the commission & apos ; s function of judge and prosecutor ?
for example , could there be a panel of independent expert during the second hearing so that it be not exclusively people from the commission who assess individual merger case ?
I also have another idea , even if it be perhaps a touch outside your sphere of authority .
might not a committee of expert or an expert tribunal , specialise in company , be set up in the department of first instance at the court in luxembourg ?
in denmark , for example , we have a special maritime and commercial court deal exclusively with issue relate to company .
I would also take the opportunity of ask the commissioner to explain why one of the most trust merger specialist have leave the commission .
the other subject I raise in my report be that of state aid and the repayment of state aid which have be award unlawfully .
I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tighten up on the repayment of state aid which have be award unlawfully , especially since this be another area it be important to sort out before enlargement .
it be good that state aid to shipyard in europe should be phase out as per 1 january 2001 , even if it be extremely problematic that our shipyard should continue to have to compete with the south korean treasury .
in the light of the late development , I can appreciate why the commission have , with good reason , adopt a hard line on south korea .
I be wonder , therefore , if you could report on the very late development , commissioner , even though I be well aware that you only have limit time available .
I also want to take the opportunity to ask commissioner monti if and when a public , efficient and properly function register of state aid may be expect to be put in place and , in the same vein , when the long - promise scoreboard be to become a reality .
finally , I want to emphasise that , for I as a liberal , it be crucially important that company can be sure of be deal with properly and efficiently in all area , so that there be no hitch where company & apo ; future legal certainty be concern .
I should also like to thank my fellow mep in committee for the splendid way in which they have cooperate in connection with my report .
mr president , I should like to thank mrs riis - jørgensen for her contribution and for her cooperation in relation to these two report .
they have be take in joint debate because common issue apply .
I endorse much of the agenda that have be set by mrs riis - jørgensen .
I should like to begin somewhat unusually by congratulate the commission on a document it publish back in june 1999 - the community rule on state aid , what I might call the & quot ; idiot & apos;s guide & quot ; to the operation of the state aid scheme .
it be helpful in that it set out the treaty provision , the definition of state aid and also the exemption from the ban on state aid .
in the course of prepare my report , I have have to struggle with that particular conundrum .
there be those in this house who will wish to emphasise the exemption ; however , I wish to make it clear that for the most part the operation of state aid work against free competition within a single market .
the single market be essential in term of promote the interest of consumer .
they must have a wide variety of high - quality , competitively price good and that , ultimately , be the reason for push forward with the single market and , along with it , free competition , because it be to the benefit of all our citizen .
turn now to the eighth survey : although there have be a reduction in the overall level of state aid during the period concern , this can in fact be attribute to a minority of member state and , take overall , ten member state have see level of state aid increase .
I know that be a matter of concern to the commissioner and it be certainly a concern I share .
I therefore welcome the indication we have receive from the commissioner that he anticipate that by july of next year we will be see progress in relation to the delivery of a state aid scoreboard and register .
that be important in term of the need for transparency .
I would ask he how he see the debate on enlargement in view of the fact that , on the one hand , we must ensure that we have a common regime across all state within the european union and , on the other hand , it must be the case that some of the candidate country have particular difficulty in adjust to new open market condition .
I would also make the point to commissioner monti that it be important that in the next survey we see a rather large section on the financial service sector .
I should like to congratulate he on a speech he make in barcelona in september - and I be very grateful to his staff for send a copy of the speech to I - devote as it be to his view on the synergy between state aid control and the financial service sector .
but in due course we must see rather more of that in the state aid report itself .
I also would wish to see change in the way that the state aid report be put together in order to ensure it be able to take account of future development .
for instance , during the period of time of this report , no state aid be give to the coal sector in the uk and yet we all know that significant aid be currently be propose by the uk government .
I take this opportunity to ask the commissioner for some information regard two case within the united kingdom where the commission have currently institute action - if indeed it be the case that action have be institute .
there be the case of the universal bank propose by the uk government to assist post office in the uk and also the venture capital scheme in the region of the united kingdom .
I understand he have ask for information concern this .
it be quite clear that throughout the report itself much attention have be direct not just to the past but also to commissioner monti & apos ; s proposal for future reform of competition policy .
that be an issue which will be come before parliament in due course .
commissioner monti will be very well aware of the concern that be share by many people who support his proposal for reform but feel that there need to be answer in relation to issue like jurisdiction shopping , legal certainty , the role of national court , dialogue between the national competition authority and the commission itself , as also issue of staff within the commission .
those be matter that we will consider in debate in due course and for which - I be delighted to inform the commission - I have be appoint parliament & apos ; s rapporteur .
mr president , lady and gentleman , in view of the lavish amount of speak time we permit ourselves for debate of this kind , I want to dispense with the preliminary and address commissioner monti directly .
commissioner , you know that for some time now , there have be a substantial consensus in this house on competition issue . this mean that the entire house support the commission in matter of competition policy .
with the passage of time though , I have begin to wonder whether the commission be not , in fact , gradually lose its sense of perspective where individual decision be concern , or whether it even want to prejudge fundamental decision in entirely different political field under the mantle of competition .
I will cite one of several example , and it be one that be currently the subject of intense debate in other region besides my own .
it concern the subsidisation decision or non - subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry .
I will take the precaution , commissioner - in case you should want to point out that this in fact fall within commissioner palacio & apos ; s remit - of say that I be address the commission as a whole .
I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue be raise both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we be discuss today .
I expect the commission to uphold its agreement .
I do not expect it to abuse judgement from the court of justice in order to withdraw from these agreement .
I will reiterate what I have already say repeatedly in debate of this kind : competition be not an end in itself .
when a decision be to be take in matter of competition policy , account must be take of the social , structural and industrial implication , and if this be not do then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology .
if the aspect I mention be take into consideration , and one consider the net product chain of the state - of - the - art technology , then the subsidy licence that have fall due for coal mining must be grant without delay .
this do not just apply to the sphere of energy policy ; it apply right across the board .
competition be important but it be not the be - all and end - all .
to sum up , what we need be to strike a balance between competition rule and act for the public good .
this must be the guide principle in all area .
commissioner , I want to take up what I say at the beginning .
the support be still there .
but if you carry on in this vein , you risk lose the support of not insignificant section of the house .
I dare say that be unlikely to help matter overall .
mr president , I be go to talk about mrs riis - jørgensen & apos ; s report .
I want to begin by congratulate she on a very good report .
one of the absolutely basic principle of eu cooperation be that competition between different company , product , country and region should work well and be fair and correct , as well as be for the benefit of consumer .
allow I to begin with something say by adam smith , the father of economic liberalism , in 1776 , to the effect that people in the same industry seldom meet for pleasure or diversion without their conversation & apo ; end with a conspiracy against the general public or some device for raise price .
certainly , a good deal have happen in the last 200 year or so , but we have the same aspiration today .
if the internal market be to operate , we must have active institution which look after issue of competition .
commissioner monti be to be congratulate in this respect .
paragraph 16 of mrs riis - jørgensen & apos ; s report talk of increase legal certainty where application for merger be concern , together with more effective and short timeframe within which to appeal before court .
this apply particularly in view of the fact that , in deal with merger , the commission have something of a double role .
the commission both supervise and apply the rule of competition .
this double role make special demand in term of openness , control and predictability .
the second paragraph I want to mention be paragraph 18 .
it be of general relevance , but its point of departure be the plan merger between motor manufacturer volvo and scania .
as be well known , the commission oppose this merger , which in turn lead to an extensive debate about how the rule of competition operate and how market share be to be calculate and assess .
a clear definition and further discussion be need in this area .
as long as the internal market be not complete , it be mainly large company in small member state which can lose out in competitiveness to company elsewhere in the world .
how be large company with large home market to be able to merge and compete in a global market if the eu & apos ; s rule make this impossible ?
come as I do from a small country , I myself be very pleased , therefore , that the committee should have adopt the amendment I propose in this connection .
I hope that the commission be now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rule of competition on the basis of these assumption .
commissioner monti , on behalf of the italian radical , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the two sound report they have produce , which commend both your work and the work of the directorate - general for competition .
I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general point regard european competition policy and also the competitiveness and opening - up of the european market , not in order to deny any progress make thusfar , but with a view to the future .
in my opinion , a particularly regrettable factor , if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop , be still the presence of large number of powerful public company in sector which have already be formally liberalise or which be currently go through this process .
I could mention , for example ... let I see ... the state monopoly of retirement pension , but I will restrict myself , more pertinently , to firm operate in the sector of general interest service .
it be my view that , in these sector , competition and the market be be severely hamper by the fact that the state be both regulator and operator .
I know , commissioner , because I have have occasion to read and hear your view on the matter , that your response to the objection be that the article of the treaty do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firm .
however , we can not be satisfied with this response if we want europe to become a more competitive and more open market in the future and - dare I say it - if we study carefully certain situation which be develop , in which even the current rule would allow we to intervene .
the whole of europe be experience the growth of an aggressive state capitalism which have result in a series of private company be take over by state monopoly or former monopoly , in any case by company which be firmly in public hand , company which be state - own .
we have hear the justification many time ; it be always ready to be trot out - we must ensure that our company and their asset retain their value through the privatisation process - meanwhile privatisation generally become more and more delayed instead of facilitated .
and , naturally , these be clearly statement to which the ear of the various minister for the treasury in europe be extremely sensitive .
in all case , these be public company whose financial prowess derive from their past and present position of monopoly rather than managerial expertise .
in many case , they be company which operate entirely or in part with considerable legal monopolistic reserve .
truly , commissioner , can we not perceive in these case the existence of state aid , conceal to a great or less extent , or abuse of a dominate position ?
or again , the transfer at the very least of the distort effect of the dominate position from one sector to another ?
or , lastly , the ever increase consolidation of the position of the incumbent which will make it difficult for newcomer to enter the various market after liberalisation ?
by way of example , deutsche post have recently gain control of dhl international and be operate under a monopoly for dispatch up to 200 gram , and then , on a more general note , we could cite the diversification of the state postal company in other sector ;
edf ( eléctricité de france ) have take over company in britain , sweden and finland , france telecom have take over orange ; on the italian side of thing , enel have take over infostrada and , still in the italian context , we could mention the various company own by local authority which be behave in a similar fashion .
lastly , commissioner , there be the case of the public financing of state television under the alibi of finance a public service , which be a concept that be fade fast .
of course , there be the treaty of amsterdam , but I wonder whether the constraint impose by the government on the excellent work of your predecessor should , in any case , be justify as a way of exempt these company from european competition rule .
mr president , we welcome the modernisation of the competition policy which , in term of set - up , have undergo little change since the sixty .
this overhaul be all the more imperative since nearly all of the member state have now establish a sound , independent competition authority .
I do not share the concern express by quite a few fellow mep with regard to the re - nationalisation of policy .
if we want to avoid a chaotic and unwieldy bureaucracy in brussels , then we have no choice but to embrace decentralisation .
I be delighted about the special attention be pay to the position of large undertaking in small member state in paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution .
these be the one experience major adverse effect from infringement of the internal market or from the continued existence of border within the internal market , because their & apo ; home market & apo ; can not sufficiently absorb these blow .
what be the commissioner & apos ; s objection to lend the concept of & apos ; relevant market & apo ; a predominantly eu - wide dimension in the event of merger ?
I would also like to draw the commissioner & apos ; s attention to the environmental significance of soil decontamination project .
naturally , we endorse the polluter pay principle . but this principle certainly can not always be apply , especially in the case of large or substantial soil decontamination project , because we will then end up with contaminated soil well into the next century .
give the staff shortage in your directorate - general , mr monti , it be not logical to accord a great deal of attention to this .
it seem to I that the effect of these project on the competitive sphere be rather minor .
finally , the book by your predecessor , and former commissioner , mr van miert , entitle & quot ; mijn jaren in europa & quot ; & # 91 ; my year in europe & # 93 ; give some idea of the blackmail - like tactic which a competition commissioner come up against .
it speak volume .
I hope you be affect by this to a less extent , but I fear the bad .
I therefore wish you all the strength and wisdom you will need to keep your chin up over the next couple of year , and I look forward to read similar memoir by yourself in due course .
mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , first of all I would like to say a warm thank you for the report we have hear about today , and which do not just record what happen in the past , but also pick out the central theme of the present debate , and even incorporate the commission & apos ; s plan .
competition be not , as have already be say , an end in itself .
it must serve the interest of consumer , company and local condition .
competition be therefore always a means to an end .
it be a vital cornerstone of our model , in term of political order , of the socio - economic market economy .
I stress this point because the market can not regulate everything , which be why competition be not completely unrestricted , nor should it be .
we therefore need two thing : firstly , in the interest of increase transparency , we need to make the public aware of all the approve subsidy that influence competition , and secondly there must be area of our day - to - day life and behaviour which be not subject lock , stock and barrel to the dictate of european competition policy .
the sport sphere or the numerous non - governmental organisation in the social and health sphere , to quote two example .
who , like we , say & apos ; yes & apos ; to a function internal market , must also have the courage of their conviction to say & apos ; yes & apos ; to european competition policy .
therefore , we welcome the modernisation of competition policy , which be initiate and then maintain by a stream of new proposal .
the community & apos ; s competition policy have be give a new european and international dimension .
in view of the enlargement process and globalisation , it be play an increasingly important part in economic relation within and outside the european union .
I therefore welcome the modernisation go on within the community on the one hand , and the fact that european competition policy now extend beyond union border .
on a final note , we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because , increasingly , the market be not the national market .
we need to promote the citizen & apo ; awareness of competition policy , so that they recognise the advantage .
we also need to step up debate in the european public arena on the relevant proposal , because they be frequently misunderstood .
what I mean - and this be direct at the public , not the commission - be that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation , but must instead lead to europeanisation .
when you delegate responsibility , you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility !
lastly , boost the citizen & apo ; autonomy must not create legal uncertainty , rather , european competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thought and action of the people beyond the institution .
we still have a lot to do on that score , commissioner !
mr president , today no one dispute , and of course I be not go to do so , the fact that state aid alter the condition for competition and be a damaging element that encourage inefficiency in undertaking .
this be certain , but if each and every one of we be honest , we have to admit that in our public life we have often defend state aid when an undertaking have require it in order to establish itself , for example , in our constituency , or in order to prevent it from close .
I begin by say this in order to highlight what be associate with some position and to point out that when we be try to issue a european parliament opinion on the annual report on state aid , the group of the europe people & apos ; s party try to conduct an ideological debate in this house on state aid in which it aim to go far than anyone and to demonise all type of aid .
this happen last year with the jonckheer report , and this year , despite the more flexible position adopt by mr evans , it have continue to arise , perhaps in order to present the socialist as some sort of outdate interventionist who use measure that be as damaging for the market as state aid .
I have already have the opportunity to express that state aid be a transfer of public money to private company and , therefore , that as socialist we should also be against it .
however , we can not deny the obvious and we should recall that the treaty do not forbid all type of aid , so some type that be aim at objective such as social cohesion , regional cohesion , the environment , etc . should be permit . if that be the case , and it be , why do the group of the europe people & apos ; s party refuse to accept amendment that cover that point ?
the same occur when the report insist , follow the commission & apos ; s line , that aid for coal do not serve to secure the future of the industry , but in the same paragraph they refuse to accept a sentence , also from the commission , say that this aid be necessary in order to mitigate the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the sector .
in this respect , it be difficult for we to agree with a report which , although it reflect part of the truth , refuse to include another part of the truth .
mr president , commissioner , mr evans and mr karas have highlight the significance of state aid and competition policy very clearly in this debate .
in future we must remember that there be national aid scheme , in respect of internal competition , for example , which be especially important and valuable in country with low population density and where distance be long .
I wish to raise one issue in this regard , that of transport aid .
I be think here of my own country , for example , where the distance be long .
in the north the price of fuel be 0.2 euro high than in southern finland .
in addition , shipment of raw material , animal feedingstuff and similar good be especially important as far as internal competition be concern and issue of major importance in order that state aid may continue to support they .
they be especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment , and I hope that in future this can be make clear , so that these aid , these internal aid , which affect regional development and the regional economy , in which transport aid be a key example , might continue .
mr president , commissioner monti , lady and gentleman , a european , open , competitive and coordinated market economy need an effective competition policy .
without a properly administer competition policy , neither the european union & apos ; s economy nor its external manifestation , in the form of the euro , will ever be able to achieve its full potential .
only a company that be competitive in the internal market without state aid can also be competitive in the global market .
however , in shape european competition policy we have to ensure that it do not limit the opportunity for company to succeed in the wide , global economy as well .
besides , a dominant market position be not even a problem unless there be evidence that this position be be abuse .
only if the dominant market position lead to adversity with regard to consumer and competitor must we tackle the situation use stringent measure , as you , mr monti , have do .
as mrs riis - jørgensen state in point 15 of her report , we have to focus on the harm cause as a result of measure restrict competition , and not so much on what sort of economic player be involve .
special account must be take of the position of small and medium - sized enterprise .
small - scale state aid might be more harmful to an sme than people think if the market be a small one .
for that reason it be good that this report of mrs riis - jørgensen & apos ; s also emphasise the importance of this .
in his report , my colleague , mr evans , thank you , mr monti , for having get to grip with the issue of state aid policy .
massive amount of state aid be still a problem in many sector .
although state aid may , on the surface , seem a good solution , when view in the long term it very rarely produce last positive result .
I certainly do not want to condemn all state aid .
there be also aid that be necessary , as lay down the treaty .
in the long run , however , level of state aid will have to fall .
state aid lead to the postponement of inevitable structural change , to the distortion of competition , and breed inefficiency .
in a sense , state aid prop up potemkin village , which at some stage will come crash down .
then it be the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill .
mr president , lady and gentleman , first of all let I express my deep disagreement with the excessively liberal , if not actually ultraliberal , tendency of the report by our fellow member , mr evans .
hear he deny the fact that state aid be reduce in the period 1994 - 1998 , even though the commission itself acknowledge this reduction , be already bizarre , to say the least .
let I add that state aid must be supervise strictly accord to the term of the treaty and not in accordance with the prevail liberal ideology .
between the omnipresent state , which no one want any more , and the completely absent state , which be nothing more than a modern - day law of the jungle , this concept which many term the european social model force we to continually seek a balance between those thing that can be govern by the market and those which public authority have a duty to regulate .
mr president , lady and gentleman , we be also to discuss the montfort report this week , which parliament want to use to promote an entrepreneurial way of thinking .
it be therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three thing in this debate .
firstly , the fact that a european charter of fundamental right have now be draft , article 16 of which establish the right to entrepreneurial freedom .
of course , this right demand strict competition law , because only this will guarantee fair competition .
it protect consumer and investor .
secondly , it be only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by karel van miert , which tell we about the mean employ by entrepreneur to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneur .
thirdly therefore , I would like to congratulate the commission and its staff on the action and decision they have take in the field of competition law , previously under karel van miert and now under your overall control , professor monti .
against this background , you have rework a communication on service of general interest and set out the legal situation once again .
this statement contain three important message .
firstly , the member state have the right to define everything that belong under this heading .
secondly , the member state have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activity .
and thirdly - and this be highly relevant to this debate - there must of course be no area which be exempt from competition law .
it be therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble .
it must not annul the general validity of community law .
hence those article in the motion for resolution which point to this fact , include the need for transparency , be particularly valuable .
, draftsperson of the opinion of the committee on legal affair and the internal market .
( es ) mr president , I would first like to apologise for having arrive late .
secondly , I would like to welcome the work do by mrs riis - jørgensen , with whom I have have an excellent and constructive relationship .
and obviously , mr president , although my opinion refer to the commission & apos ; s 29th report on competition policy , it be inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past , but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future .
it have be say - and I be only go to pick up on what have be say so far - that competition be presently the big word in our society , it be the great catalyst for the development of our society , particularly of our european society .
therefore , mr president , we need to recognise that , with member state that be cease to be producer and become regulator , the commission policy need to change , and in this sense , this report be part of that important development .
in its opinion , the committee on legal affair and the internal market do nothing more than highlight something which have be say and repeat : that we need clear rule , because this be the only way of know what the rule of play be .
we can not leave everything to the market with no regulation at all .
what we need be clear rule and - I stress - rule that be of a sufficient level or category .
in any event , interpretation or interpretative communication be no good .
and also , of course , that the commission & apos ; s policy , which we welcome and support in the committee on legal affair and the internal market , should not be shape , in this process of decentralisation , to the detriment of small and medium - sized business , to the detriment of the citizen .
I will end with a phrase from john rawls , the philosopher of law : inequality be always justify when they increase the level of the system and support the weak without affect fundamental right .
commissioner , know how far this go in the universal service , in public service , be the great challenge for the commission .
mr president , lady and gentleman , I would like to thank the committee on economic and monetary affair and parliament in general for the great interest that it have once again display in matter of competition .
mr heartfelt thank to mrs riis - jørgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur of the xxixth report on competition policy .
a big thank you to mr evans as well , for his excellent report on the rule govern state aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on state aid in the european union .
all three report assume considerable importance in the light of the effort the commission have make to increase the transparency of its competition policy and to explain what it be do to the citizen .
on the subject of explain competition policy , I would like to say that I be extremely pleased with the success of the first two european competition day , which be hold in lisbon on 9 june and in paris on 17 october this year .
the idea be conceive in this parliament and develop by parliament and the commission .
my feeling be that , together , we be make progress in help the citizen to understand this policy .
I would like to stress that I fully agree with much of what have be say and with very many of the point contain in the resolution .
mr president , in the time available to I , I would like to focus on the follow three point : the modernisation of community competition law , the practical application of competition rule in 1999 and state aid .
on the subject of modernisation , I will attempt , within the constraint impose , to respond to some of the extremely interesting point which have be raise .
the annual report on competition policy emphasise the need to modernise the legislative and interpretative framework of community competition law in the area of both monopoly and state aid .
I will not go into the detail of the reform project which have recently be complete or be still be develop , for they have already be the subject of a specific consultation process between the commission and parliament , or will be in the future , in the constructive dialogue which be so valuable .
with regard to state aid , in my opinion , the entry into force , in 1999 , of the rule of procedure be a considerable step forward .
they increase transparency and establish the deadline for adopt the decision on state aid .
as far as monopoly be concern , the commission adopt a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 september last .
a great many observation make by parliament during consultation over the white paper be take into account even as early as at the stage of draw up the proposal .
particular attention be pay to the concern express by parliament regard renationalisation and legal certainty .
I would therefore like to assure mrs palacio , mr karas and the other member who speak on these point that the regulation take their concern into ample consideration .
I be now wait for the commencement of the second stage of dialogue between our two institution on these legislative proposal and I be sure that it will be as constructive as the first stage .
as you know , on 9 and 10 november , the commission and parliament be jointly organise a conference on this reform in freiburg , a conference propose for the first time precisely in your resolution on the white paper .
my second point be the application of the competition rule during 1999 .
in the year in question , there be an unusually large number of case require the use of considerable resource and which be close by formal decision .
one of the thing I appreciate be your call for an increase in human resource .
the commission have continue to intervene resolutely , particularly where cartel and abuse of a dominate position be concerned .
as in the debate on merger , since time be limited and I prefer to attempt to answer some of the specific question , I will not mention the major - albeit numerous - intervention we have make .
the third point be state aid .
I be happy to note the support which parliament continue to lend we in relation to the eighth survey too .
I welcome parliament & apos;s proposal on the future development of these information tool , which will include the register and the scoreboard as well as audits .
I confirm to mr evans and the other member who have speak on this subject that we will be ready to present the initial version of the register and the scoreboard - mrs riis - jørgensen also uphold this idea - before june 2001 , and I be confident that transparency will be an important additional tool for the application of the legal instrument govern state aid .
mr president , I would now like to focus on at least some of the specific point raise .
several member - mrs riis - jørgensen , mr schmidt , mr blokland and mrs kauppi - have pose the problem of large company operate in relatively small country .
could we not relax the definition of the relevant market there , when it come to merger operation ?
well , if the relevant market , on the basis of the analysis conduct , happen to be national in scope , you must realise that do what you suggest would amount to discrimination against the consumer and customer in those national market .
what we have to work together for be to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market go beyond the national market .
otherwise we would be serve our purpose of help competition and the consumer in a perverse way .
I add , in relation to the specific volvo - scania case that I be sure underlie many speaker & apo ; remark , that both company have be able to reach solution that make their own further international growth compatible with the protection of the interest of competition and consumer in those market .
should we introduce a panel of independent expert to assess merger ?
the recourse to external expertise can be useful and already take place in a number of case .
but the commission should not and will not give its ultimate responsibility of take decision to an external body .
it belong to we .
it may , on occasion , be uncomfortable , but this be our task .
concern the problem of one dg competition official who resign , I have already express my regret about that resignation .
far increase the right of defence , the transparency of the procedure , include the enhance position of the hearing officer , be something to which I be very much attached and upon which I be reflect , take into account several input include the useful idea provide by that official before he resign .
as far as korea be concern , mr lamy , who will be come here during the course of the week , will be well place to update you on the late development .
I can only , for my part , state my conviction that any extension of operate state aid to shipyard would not be the appropriate response to a situation that require other type of intervention .
mr evans , I very much share your concern on the issue of state aid to financial service .
we will pursue that point with determination .
mr rapkay , it have be extremely important for the commission to have the support of the european parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away .
look at the resolution we be discuss today , I see the commission & apos ; s policy as very much in line with a vigorous implementation of those resolution .
in the area notably of state aid , it must not be think that the commission believe in a pure or ultra - liberal policy .
state aid have their place but it be a fact that in many case the concrete manifestation of state aid go well beyond what the treaty allow and what the guideline allow .
but believe I , I certainly see competition policy as an instrument of a social market economy .
the strong the implementation of competition the well the market tend to be .
there be full scope for social aspect provide they be not mix up in a non - transparent way with the functioning of the market .
you mention deutsche post : for example , procedure be currently in progress at the commission on deutsche post in respect of both these area , and I can assure you that the commission do not intend the protocol annex to the treaty of amsterdam on public television broadcasting to create a condition prevent appropriate control of state aid on this matter as well .
in this regard , and as far as state aid be concern , I refer you to the communication adopt by the commission on 20 september on service of general economic interest .
mr president , I think I have exceed the time allow to I .
I apologise to those to whose question I have not have time to respond .
I would , however , like to end by quote the report of the legal affair committee .
it state , mrs palacio :
all too often commission decision in the field of competition be present in the press as defeat for national interest rather than victory for the internal market and for the consumer . & apos ;
our intention be to have more and more of these victory and to be more and more able to explain they to european consumer and to european citizen .
of course , parliament have a very important role to play in this respect .
mr president , I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the commissioner .
I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of parliament , and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter .
I merely want to clarify that I speak here on behalf of the second large group , and express a real concern of our , and if you hear mr caudron speak , then you would be aware that this be not something I alone be concern about , because it be also something that bother another mep .
and so I only speak on behalf of my group , and not for parliament as a whole .
the debate be close .
