i see far faster movement in the economic and internal market sphere than in the social sphere and there be real danger of a grow imbalance in that respect . we know , however , that there be still many obstacle which need to be overcome in order to reach agreement , particularly in matter relate to its independence and jurisdiction . i would dwell at length on what be the guide principle of this proposal , but i shall limit myself to consider growth and employment . although this process of establish the internal market in service be very important for europe ’ s economic development , the rule ensure european social cohesion must be comply with . sideline this section of the debate once again will not help us , in my opinion , to break the deadlock . mr commissioner , you have primarily concentrate on the logistical and technical aspect , and you have only just begin to touch on the monetary risk that could ensue from what you call the gigantic holding by foreigner of german mark but also presumably of other euro zone currency . this mean that the european parliament must develop effective instrument so that it can exert control over the application of the programme , as well as proper budgetary management . the necessary information on each member state must be make available so as to increase the effectiveness of control and monitoring system , and to ensure that we have a true picture of the situation . one thing be certain , one thing which i have learn in the course of my contact with country which , only recently , be suffer under communist dictatorship : those country can not emerge unaided . mr president , i be sorry that almost no member of the elect european commission be present . member of the commission . - everyone in this chamber will know that the commission have be a very strong and present partner in the peace and reconciliation process in northern ireland for year . this company have deliberately not pay its employee the money owe to them , either in full – i have statement that this have occur – or in part . that be the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you , commissioner – on various minimum size , which we would have like to fix more decisively : sardine and cod caught in the northern sea do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the mediterranean . i would like to mention that the european union & apos ; s accession to the european convention on human right obviously will not resolve the problem of the european court of human right be completely overload with work . amendment nos 2 , 4 and 14 should in fact be set aside in favour of amendment no 21 , which be intend to promote the safe handling of these material so as to avoid serious environmental consequence . we be all right behind you . it be also interest to note that cfsp will not really mean & apos ; common foreign and security policy & apos ; as long as it be totally off-limits to discuss , within the framework of our foreign policy cooperation , what two of the member state of this union be do in the un security council . i would , however , urge them to read the text carefully . we must fight torture , terrorism and every crime against humanity . do europe really not have the authority to say to israel ‘ it be time to end the israeli military occupation ’ ? that be why labour euro mp vote against call for a 5 % budget increase . since that occasion in april 2003 there have be a considerable amount of effort , discussion and negotiation on the part of parliament and the council in order to arrive at the compromise before you today . to bridge this gap , however , the european people & apos ; s party do not believe the solution lie in adopt a comprehensive directive that would be difficult to implement and inefficient . commissioner , please ensure that , if there be an avian flu jab , it will be mercury-free . there be nine other applicant country - if i leave aside cyprus and malta where it be presumably easy to control the border - so we have ten applicant country , all with problem like this , without enough money to meet the cost . in addition , i would like to underline another important factor mention in the relevant report which be that the conclusion of these agreement will imply a considerable financial burden for macedonia and other western balkan country . the french government have initiate a discussion and make proposal to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fight against the phenomenon of flag of convenience and by implement much more extensive inspection . the first month have give us only a vague picture of the intention of the authority in minsk . finally , we should be able to quickly draw the consequence of a piece of legislation , the implementation of which create more problem than it solve . moreover , even if it be important for many authority to collect revenue for the information it produce when it be be use for commercial purpose , it be important that our citizen can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own life and health without have to pay for it . it be very much in the spirit of the entente cordiale . mr president , lady and gentleman , i should now like to focus on the specific lesson that i have draw from this affair , and set out some proposal which , i hope , will correspond to your recommendation for the future . in short , we shall vote in favour of the brinkhorst report , as i say , despite our doubt as to how effective a weapon this will be against the council . this would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another see its number peak . fitzsimons recommendation ( a4-0052 / 99 ) it be about time we put more ethanol in petrol , and with the new decision we will at least have half the rate that brazil have . on behalf of my group i should like to say that my group congratulate mr verde i aldea for his report . unfortunately , recent statement from some people do not encourage optimism . the problem of mobility pose a multitude of risk , however . be it an attempt to move closer towards the syrian and libyan dictatorship , which be constantly violate human right ? the second area which i believe should be a particular priority for us be the development of intercultural relation . indeed , over the last year and a half in particular , bloody terrorist brutality have shake the entire world . the draft budget envisage a drastic reduction in the appropriation allocate to this line . obviously , that everything possible should be do to obtain a cease-fire within the framework of a regional conference for peace , security and stability in the region , which could be hold under the aegis of the un and the oau . the european structural fund grant the local and regional authority and the social player extensive right of participation . with regard to honduras , i would remind you that the honduras army be in multinational hand , and that when the honduras tax authority wish to levy tax on a crate of banana , they be forbidden to do so . we welcome president khatami & apos ; s intervention , the action of lecturer and student in protesting and dr aghajari & apos ; s own appeal for calm . mr president , i greatly welcome the argo action programme . we should be give the country that be about to join us a sheaf of unambiguous and harmonised regulation that they know they can stick to and be guide by . i will concentrate on two area . this have attract the support of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and of parliament . just ask journalist in brussels , for example . the people there be now try , especially in tunisia and egypt , to build new country - democratic country where there be respect for fundamental right and the rule of law . mr president , the symbol of the red cross / red crescent movement bring hope to battlefields worldwide . mr president , it seem to me that we need to distinguish two aspiration which be contain in the galeote report and which to some extent lead in different direction . but we must go far and be more ambitious . an important step forward . that be why these objective be more important than ever . let me refer , by way of example , to mr khanbhai & apos ; s report , which reveal some problem in the ecsc account , include , among other thing , the solvency ratio and the transfer of property , although the commission and the high authority be currently reduce these problem with a view to the expiry of the ecsc treaty in 2002 . i be quite simply state the political reality , which be not very positive , and i strongly urge the council to draw lesson from this negative situation and ensure that , the next time the treaty be review , the structure be change , as the current shortcoming of the institution be prevent us from do good . i know that i have by no mean cover all our foreign policy area , but i should like to conclude with a few thought on the change nature of european integration . i would draw parliament & apos ; s attention to the fact that this be indeed a natural disaster for these flood and this rain be twenty time great than normal . indeed , as he say , we have reach a very satisfactory outcome . by way of conclusion , i should like to say that the situation seem to be improve , although a very great deal remain to be do . if we be to believe the rapporteur , the risk from uncontrolled use of herbal medicine be considerable . in fact , the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt , which reach 7.1 % of gdp in 2001 - and be estimate as 4 % of gdp in 2002 - meant that the evolution of the debt ratio do not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administration , the achievement of increasingly high primary surplus or the growth in gdp . to sum up , for all the reason i have give , i do not think it be acceptable to allow the citizen to shoulder all the responsibility . we now need to build on that hope together . as the house will know and as have be remark again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential election early this year result in the change of government in croatia and bring a new political climate . a few other meps have already mention this topic , and we have also discuss it with the commissioner within the framework of the committee on foreign affair , human right , security and defence policy . i be convince that this be the main reason for the declaration by the israeli ambassador to ukraine , mrs kalay-kleitman , who state in an interview with the serkalo nedeli that israel can not recognise the holodomor as an act of ethnic genocide . it be have also play a crucial role in ease sectarian tension and bridge the division between the two tradition on the island . we consider that the limit on tac change should be plus or minus 15 % to be in accordance with scientific advice . that be the signal . the committee on legal affair look at this issue through legal spectacle , as you would expect . mr president , i be just about to say that the issue of information be also fundamental . nor do i believe that it make sense to wire the whole parliament and install a wireless lan in all the building ; these be not our core task in this connection . a legal basis must therefore be decide at the intergovernmental conference in order to enable the council to vote by qualified majority , no longer unanimously , within the social sphere . they be do a good job and need to know that they can sign contract for building and pay salary for next year . mr president , we see more and more every day how a common european immigration policy have become essential . at this point , i welcome mr patten & apos ; s commitment to transparency in the use of european aid . the other hurdle that you must surmount be the paucity of public preparedness . she be a very fine example of how a rapporteur should behave in conduct parliament & apos ; s business and committee business . if we want to make a go of multilateralism , then we ourselves need to set an example , be consistent and show how well it can work in the future , because the imf have an absolutely crucial role to play in the field of global governance , a role that transcend the issue of european debt and of the sovereign debt situation of the european country that be struggle . everyone know how crucial and burn this issue be , with the partisan of prohibition and the tenant of an & apos ; alternative policy & apos ; often pole apart . mr president , let me thank commissioner papoutsis , because i think he have take some important initiative which go beyond mere word and extend to the promotion of practical measure , no matter how difficult they may be and how many obstacle have to be overcome . firstly , there be broad consensus about the european union & apos ; s ability , within the nato framework , to defend itself against any conceivable aggressor , whether this be do together with our ally , or , if need be , independently . we have not make sufficient reference to former debate we have have in relation to the severe problem that implementation of this legislation will entail for certain region such as small island and isolated mountain region . specific directive will then be adopt within this framework . interinstitutional cooperation should therefore become more vigorous in the future and the role of the european parliament in particular should be make more prominent . nevertheless , i wish to stress once again that economic hardship can not serve as a pretext for undemocratic behaviour . as some of you may already know , there be a leaked document on the future of the common agricultural policy towards 2020 , which also address the territorial challenge of the future . it be therefore extremely important that the eu act in cooperation with the world health organisation , or who . the so-called war veteran - they must have be very young when the war of independence be on - have be pay to be on these farm . mr president , it would thus mean that if you know that all the protein originate from abroad , say from south america , that you will soon also need to label absolutely everything with gmo identification within the framework of this novel food directive . the commission will far investigate specific requirement for lpg combustion heater to be add in annex viii . it should respect the law and the rule , and immediately declare that further ratification of the now dead lisbon treaty be a completely useless exercise . i stress this point because , in point of fact , among the priority that have be indicate i can see three that meet this requirement of sustainable development for the men and woman live in those country . but she be present , there she be . as long as there be due consideration for the environment , the eu & apos ; s objective should be to abolish all subsidy and to place farmer and food producer on an equal footing with other manufacturer and business in the union . . mr president , this have be a very useful , rather balance and proportionate debate , but i well understand the huge anxiety and sensitivity that be excite by this issue of textile . the decision to favour grow organic fodder legume alone have not reassure the operator in this sector . there may have be time when our instrument be slightly out of tune , but we have work extremely well together . the rule should be as easy as possible for these institution to use . on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( de ) madam president , the amount of waste equipment be increase dramatically . but we do have serious reservation on two point . in addition , we can accept two amendment if we alter the wording slightly . one transnational civil protection mechanism may help in deal with natural disaster . in the light of the commission & apos ; s option as present , we , like the rapporteur , take the view that the list should not be far extend at this stage . question no 37 by konstantinos hatzidakis ( h-0324 / 02 ) : the people who pay the bill be the customer of these company , who pay them in high price and , above all , the people of europe , who be price out of job . mr president , minister , i would like to ask if any decision of principle have be take regard whether there should be a mandate from the un or any other international organisation in discharge such task as these , as , under international law , a mandate from an international organisation be need before any country & apos ; s territory can legally be attack in this way . we must therefore take action wherever there be a threat to the world & apos ; s cultural heritage . it be a remarkable dossier we be discuss here , a highly technical one . code of conduct for computerised reservation system ( debate ) in conclusion , we must achieve an effective control , application and notification system , as state in recital a , but this system will inevitably require of the member state a spirit of mutual trust and accountability and an equal commitment to notify infringement securely and effectively . as a result , the money of the fund will not be spend , and we will miss a major opportunity for development in eastern europe . i should like , if i may , to divide what i have to say into two part : the first provide a specific commission response to the four report on the agenda , that be the péry report , the two arias cañete report and the kofoed report ; and a second in which i shall attempt to reply to more general issue raise here by many colleague and many honourable member . today , if we want to put a stop to these horror , it be necessary , before all else , to name the guilty party : islam , which , like communism , seek to use terrorism as a mean of impose a totalitarian system . after thirty year of be ignore , of silence and of broken promise , the time have come for the world in general , and europe in particular , to stop turn its back on the problem and to face it head on . seven year after the iranian regime try to convince the iranian and the international community that it be open to change and to democratisation , it be now clear - to all the observer , and to the iranian people first and foremost - that nothing have change for the good and no improvement in the human right situation or the democratic right have take place . in our first action programme , eeurope 2002 , we have a special approach to e-transport , but it be not , unfortunately , able to create sufficient interest among the member state . i think that it be a general rule in this house that if the commission wish to speak out on something , it actually do so . the objective of adequate , safe and high quality food be a human requirement and demand of the worker which can not be safeguard within the framework of the capitalist method of production and trade in agricultural product . mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , angola be still suffer from war , destruction and the senseless , shock loss of human life . however , these shortcoming should not cloud the fact that an impressive job have be do on the ground by the agency & apos ; s staff . i believe that this really be a very significant issue and it be very important because it affect all the member of a parliament whose power , we must admit , have increase . however , the commission do not consider that research involve embryo should be exclude as such from the union & apos ; s research programme , and just now i refer to the opportunity that such research can provide in very important sector . i consider the report , which agree with the conclusion of a voluntary partnership agreement between cameroon and the european union , to be worthy of support during the vote . we work very hard with the spanish presidency in recent month . in 2006 alone , europe be richer by eur 240 billion , or the equivalent of eur 518 for every european citizen because of the single market . we should seize that opportunity within a wider northern dimension policy . there be no room for fudge or lack of clarity . the spanish be the main beneficiary , with the canary where 91 % of the fleet be dependent on this agreement , and with andalusia where 75 % of the fleet be involve , and there would be a cost to pay if there be to be no agreement . ( mt ) mr president , it be a disgrace that , once again , so many people have to lose their life before the european union & apos ; s lack of concrete action on immigration be expose . on hear this you say : & apos ; yes , of course that be quite right & apos ; , but this appeal would in fact suggest that the european union and the european member state have be far too quick to seize their weapon in the past , in different context . the spirit of schengen be a spirit of trust and solidarity . the amount propose corresponds to 20 % of the appropriation for head five and therefore respect the ceiling which the european parliament itself set for 2001 . now some point for the future . i believe that the political will show yesterday by the representative of the various political grouping in the discussion of the committee on budget will bear fruit . mr green spoke in favour of the resolution which be put to this chamber . moreover , the convention establish no link with other community databases - some of which have already be mention , such as scent or irene - the database for the fight against fraud , or the ida proposal to facilitate the smooth functioning of the single market . the rule of procedure stipulate that in these case , the presidency have the last word as regard the applicable interpretation . the council & apos ; s hesitation concern article 3 make it abundantly clear how crucial it be for parliament to be give the right of codecision make on competition policy . if we no longer want turkish secularism to be defend by the army or by judicial coup , let woman take care of this . it have already be decide that we will conduct negotiation in parallel with all three country , but they will not necessarily be complete at the same time . although there be some worthwhile objective - for example , the twinning of city , civic project , various survey and study , art event and conference - there be others that be indicative of unacceptable political influence , such as exclude fascist crime from support under new action 4 - active european memory . this be why we be there and why we need to remain there . first of all , the committee propose take into account the health of worker and consumer protection , by introduce the precautionary principle and the principle that the best available technology should be use so as to keep radiation as low as possible . a great deal will depend on how the member state themselves implement the provision of this regulation , however . 1 . we have 70 amendment to a report on chicken , seek to improve condition for lay hen , in particular by impose requirement for more space and stimulus . but although europe aspires to run a frontier-free market , the eu can not regulate these transfrontier vital service . tobacco consumption must regularly decrease and production must continue to be limit to a constant tonnage of 351 000 gross tonne of european tobacco , between the propose new com and the present com . i say yes , and i believe that other honourable member will share that view . the eu must help our citizen who be in trouble as a result of the worldwide crisis . it be another gradual step forward , definitely not backwards . thus , we be certainly among those who offer the czech presidency particular support and do not intend to attach too much importance to teethe problem - the rather one-sided initial position on the gaza conflict and the czech president & apos ; s view that social and environmental standard be too high have already be mention . besides , parliament & apos ; s passion for regulation , as bear out by so many amendment , will result in a regulation that be difficult to implement . noise pollution be very disturbing and can form a threat to health . thank you . i dare to hope that this bizarre collusion be not the result of any shameful bargaining . the statement of assurance be suppose to cover & apos ; down to the level of taxpayer & apos ; . i be grateful for the constructive and very positive involvement of nearly all of you . you take the unprecedented step – the fifth enlargement but the first time ever – to invite observer mp from every state , and that be greatly to your credit . trans-european network be urgently require . our task now be to continue work for the civil and custom protection of our geographical indication , which be damage by competition which be at the very least unfair , due to the constant use of name and acronym that reference the best-known european brand . it be also high time , i believe , that the commission abandon its blind belief in neo-liberalism and , instead of accept a downward spiral of competitive deflation and fiscal dumping , change course to return to and build on the idea of brüning , to create a situation and a policy that would take us beyond keynes . be you propose to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect ? we hope that the european parliament will become ever more involve in protect these right and , above all , we be pleased to support the idea of continuous monitoring of all the legislative activity that will lead to such protection , which , as the commissioner be say , could culminate in a final report . the german federal government , our political party , social partner , employer & apos ; and worker & apos ; association , will not tolerate the planned restriction on our posting of worker legislation , and other european country have similar misgiving . owe to the expansion of nato right up to russia & apos ; s border , the us be politically , even more than militarily , responsible for have encourage georgia to mount its surprise attack during the night of 7 to 8 august . it be essential for the european union to take a close interest in these five country : uzbekistan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and kazakhstan . you be embark on your presidency with more modesty , and i think you be right to do so . the journey take a very long time , the lorry use be full to burst point , and the animal be short of water , food , and ventilation . i wonder about the future of this report from the point of view of its integration into european policy . in term of research , the commission welcome parliament & apos ; s support for the development of a comprehensive marine research strategy which will be a cornerstone of maritime policy , and should be ready for adoption by mid-2008 . i personally oppose this . all this mark the transition to economic and monetary union on 1 january 1999 . almost 90 % of the complaint submit by my fellow countryman from the czech republic do not fall within the remit of the european ombudsman . it be pointless for us to make correction if they be not record . this contain two point of criticism put forward by my group , which , to our satisfaction , have end up in mr lalumière & apos ; s report . if we be ask to explain thing - e.g . why something be do or be leave undone - we be always available to you , to the ombudsman and to other people as well . lady and gentleman , i urge you to vote against the megaliners in paragraph 21 . we must all keep our finger firmly cross . i be in favour of us include this service within the commission , as that be where it belong . everyone say that they be in favour of enlargement , but when it come to pay the price of solidarity , political selfishness rear its head . it also call on the commission and the member state to develop a legal framework that recognise the social economy as a third sector as well as to set up clear rule for establish which entity can legally operate as social economy enterprise . by mr fjellner , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the european training foundation for the financial year 2007 ( c6-0437 / 2008 - , it be certainly not true that we be try to ignore the matter . that time – now for reflection , as identify by the european council – will continue for a number of month . mr president , lady and gentleman , my thanks for the presentation of the court of auditor report . they do not want to give eurostat and the european commission more power to examine in depth the greek national account . this matter have to be discuss far , however ; unilateral step must be avoid at all cost . it be interest that the british minister of agriculture , mrs beckett , have say that she will decide when farmer can go into the field , or when it be too wet or have be rain . finally , a word about the riot . i fully and firmly support what mr barón crespo say . these be not triviality , they be very serious event and europe need to be concern with them , especially when an important partner be involve . . – mr president , first of all , of course , i must congratulate my group colleague mr seppänen on his outstanding report ; he be right to stress the primary responsibility that be incumbent on the member state where the storage or processing of nuclear waste be concern , and they certainly have one when it come to refuse to accept waste from outside their own border . as the draftsman of the rex committee , i have take a look at the draft regulation and , like mr virgin , i could only shake my head at some of the point propose there . lukashenko have clearly state that he will not bow to pressure from the west , and in negotiation with medvedev on reduce gas price , he declare that belarus will not be indebted to russia . what be it then that they be rely on us to do ? . – the archipelago of the azores , madeira and the canary island , and the french overseas department , be refer to as the eu ’ s outermost region and be characterise by their remoteness , insularity , small size , difficult topography and climate and economic dependence on a few product . the debate on the future of europe involve all the main player ; it take place in the full light of day ; and it produce a coherent text on which the intergovernmental conference have be able to work effectively . because people in european country be seemingly in danger of fail to understand these matter , the european parliament be suggest to the member state that they adopt ‘ the measure necessary to promote understanding of immigration and integration as positive factor for the economy and for economic growth , and as element of cultural enrichment ’ ( paragraph 20 ) . the badger-spread disease be first discover on the day he be due to leave on a two-week holiday last june , and he have since lose 64 of his 82-strong herd . when and where the right of the minority be observe , the society will for the most part be just and tolerant . in write . - ( nl ) i emphatically vote against this report . the market be quite capable of regulate itself . how be they and their child look after ? they be coffee , butter , rice , pasta and drinking milk . i agree very strongly with the speaker who say that it be not the european union itself that be in crisis but that a part , a good part , of the member state have become entangle in a debt crisis , a debt spiral . mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , i should like to add my thanks to the commission , which have remain as faithful as it possibly could to parliament ’ s position . the legitimate representative of the saharan people now accept the new draft solution advocate by kofi annan ’ s special envoy . this directive alter the very definition of chocolate which should , in our opinion , be make from cocoa butter and bean . the guide for applicant for these measure , involve complex paperwork , be make public one day before the launch of the session , although they have be write in august . be we go to concern ourselves with strengthen legal safeguard as much as possible while terrorist move freely from one continent to another and mercilessly murder thousand of people , who – incidentally – have not be give any right to defend themselves ? the competitiveness of the european steel industry also form the subject of the commission & apos ; s most recent communication , which we have not yet debate in parliament . it be base on four key objective : promote early diagnosis , improve epidemiological knowledge of the disease , support solidarity between member state , and respect the right of people live with the various form of dementia . consequently , through these action finnish shipyard have achieve world-wide competitiveness , which the commission be now try to take away from us . approval of the minute of the previous sit this proposal aim at fight more effectively the exploitation of migrant worker through dissuasive administrative sanction and through penal sanction in the most serious case , include trafficking , and where particularly exploitative work condition be find . above all , do it intend to heed the wish of citizen of entire region of europe , where the majority of the population wish to protect itself against gmos , or do the commission intend instead to be seduce by the misleading publicity allege technological progress ? the money would have be take out of football if there have be a heavy fine . all this make for continued tension when it come to the demand for openness on the part of the ecb . company receive credit , they invest , they want to make money , but when there be mobilisation by local group that have be exclude or due to price rise result from privatisation , the european company then decide to leave and furthermore demand compensation for it , which aggravate the crisis even far . this should further the cross-national mobility of student , the recognition of diploma and qualification and the free movement of qualified student in europe . nonetheless , we trust that it will provide ample opportunity for thought and will inspire us to adopt measure , now that the european parliament be prepare to enlarge and to welcome representative from the new member state . it be the large portuguese exporter , and before be know for the problem that lead to its insolvency , it be prepare to invest in new technology and have secure public funding to support the production of solar cell . i would simply like to propose go to brazil , for example , to see what become of child there who be from broken or single-parent family . in any case , the application of unilateral sanction against european product on the part of the united state would be unacceptable and would seriously damage the trust and cooperation that characterise our relationship . the scientific report say that all of them pose a risk to health and that one of them both cause cancer and aggravate it , and you dare to say in all seriousness , sir leon , that now there should be great transparency . at the same time , any change or replacement will be easy for the major company , whereas small- to medium-sized enterprise will be unable to handle the cost and thus shrink in size . progress be slow ; the work consumes 6 % of ukraine & apos ; s gross national income . i would now like to make a statement . we should also look at environmental and social policy and , when we talk of progress for these country , it be important that we do not simply measure , as the commission often do , growth in foreign investment and the economy , but that we also look at how far the country be able to incorporate aspect of the work environment and social policy into their competition policy . that would perhaps make it easy to settle the ongoing debate in france and other european country on reality television . i also take the liberty of add a few comment of my own . the commission proposal as they stand now , if implement in their entirety , would have the following detrimental effect on irish agriculture . we be glad the council have accept a proposal to append to the decision an additional statement from the commission on encourage the participation of small and medium-sized ngo , and the possibility of fully fund their action by national agency . in this recommendation for second reading , the european parliament propose in amendment nos 4 , 5 , and 7 that as far as the registration of passenger be concern , company operate a railway tunnel must meet the same requirement as those operate a passenger ship . however , the same concern about consistency prevents us from accept amendment nos 3 , 7 and 14 . it be essential from the point of view of the union & apos ; s credibility that word and deed go hand in hand . nevertheless , this year it express ‘ grave concern at the continuation of the israeli-palestinian conflict ’ . the rapporteur , my colleague wim van velzen , have produce an excellent report , undoubtedly with the support of the committee on employment and social affair . i support the conclusion that a different instrument be need to close this gap for non-oda ( official development assistance ) activity . the culture of cronyism and hiding behind collective decision-making have to come to an end . in a moment my colleague vladimir špidla will outline to you the approach the commission adopt today . today & apos ; s world be evidently different . it be pie in the sky to think that difference in europe can be erase with socio-economic intervention . the commission also appreciate the important role the european parliament play in put the fight against violence on the agenda of the european union . we know there be ongoing work . those who say , however , that the summit be not , in itself , the end of the road and that it will not , by itself , revolutionise relation with africa be right . as a result of the work of my colleague in this parliament , past and present , especially mr bowis , we can be content in have take a step forward in ensure clarification for patient , improve healthcare choice and great cooperation between the different eu healthcare system . it be a multidimensional problem . perhaps these position , when read in context , will help us to extricate ourselves from the present conflict between large and small state , which be paralyse the intergovernmental conference . you know that at the first stage , we be propose a regime for the euro area member state and , at the second stage , for all 27 member state . in the light of these circumstance , there be still a consensus that eradication of the present outbreak without the use of generalised vaccination be the best course of action . secondly , the codecision procedure have be considerably simplify , mainly by abolish the third reading which parliament so abhorred . it be bad for them . we have a long way to go before we be perfect ourselves . - report : leinen ( fi ) madam president , i want to mention three matter very briefly . in conclusion , i call on all my colleague to support this report and i take this opportunity to extend an invitation to you all to visit cyprus in 2008 , to enjoy cypriot hospitality and to spend your euro freely in the sun . with new legislative proposal , we should not be push to provide opinion and report at breakneck speed which allow us little time for thought and consultation with interest group and citizen . i would like to inform the house that , as rapporteur , i support the amendment table by the socialist but can not accept the ppe and the gue / ngl amendment . i will give my reason for that . congratulation to all the rapporteur on their work . the debate be close . the commission have provide no fact whatsoever to demonstrate why it be necessary ; instead we be refer to a theoretical danger . i think we should do something about this . mrs plooij-van gorsel , i can answer you at least in part . we will always be on the side of democracy and not of tyranny . an agreement be reach last weekend thanks to concession both from member state and meps . you can write anything you like on paper . i hope that i be not right , but if we go on like this , perhaps we should join in a chorus of & quot ; nearer my god to thee & quot ; , stand in the middle and sing it . for this reason , we have to support a un-led solution that be as prompt and peaceful as possible . therefore , what sustainable development project be the commission implement for niger ? 3 600 people dead , most of them civilian . the case of manuel rosales only confirm what i be say . it be about time we discuss this shameful subject , address this inhumane phenomenon , and begin to effectively counteract sexual assault in haiti . - ( fr ) at its meeting of 7 may 1999 , the european parliament adopt the eu-mexico global agreement even though none of its member know the term of negotiation of its trade aspect . the paralogism of the past must stop . almost a quarter of romanian territory will become arid in the next 20 year and many plant specie will disappear . subsequently , the introduction of a common european system for compare fingerprint should be consider . i believe that this be a very rigorous , very interesting and very well execute piece of work on a genuinely difficult subject . actually , they have do something . they have massively finance their public postal service company and now , rationalise , finance , with enormous economic power , they intend to enter the rest of the european union & apos ; s postal service market . russia appear to be an essential partner in seek this lasting solution to the crisis in kosovo . what be hard to take in this whole situation be the fact that this reflect the relationship between the eu and russia . towards a common european foreign policy on energy ( debate ) my fellow member from greece , mr rapti , mention that there be political undertone behind the desire to amalgamate agency , and she say that we must not interfere with agency in greece . no one in europe have lose their identity but , and this be the important point , make them work together in their substantial common interest which be social and economic , as i often say & apos ; spill their sweat and not their blood & apos ; , and by do that we can breakdown the barrier and century and the new europe will have evolve . lastly , i welcome the proposal that structural fund should be use to support r & # 91 ; amp & # 93 ; d action at regional level and a ‘ european excellence label ’ . mr president , my group would also like to express its condolence to those involve in the samina express disaster . western company continue to exploit their patent monopoly on technique and crop , development cooperation focus too little on agriculture and technological expertise be not pass on . i hope that the member state will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealing with it . i can not imagine that we would bring toys into circulation which claim 5 million victim annually . discussion on debt relief for the country seriously affect by the disaster in the indian ocean be go on in paris . the vote will be take tomorrow at 12 noon . look at from that angle , it be good and necessary that the commission want to do some repair and so attaches primary importance to the transport facility have great and good interoperability and intermodality and intend to see to it that the candidate country be well interconnect , tie in and involve . when we speak about a competitive market , again interconnection be an absolute necessity . meanwhile , it be become understood that a great reliance have to be place on a sustainable model of production and consumption , and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resource . this house have actually press for that . be that the case ? milosevic do not in fact set in motion his devilish machinery to wipe out a whole people at the moment when nato start bomb . nor can the commission accept amendment nos 23 , 24 and 25 . one of these amendment propose the implementation and application of the policy of the financial instrument for fishery . so besides adopt specific resolution - and there be clearly no objection to that , which be why we be debate it here - , perhaps we ought in future to examine another more effective way not just of express solidarity but of become more effective in substance . the three report outline several possible direction of work in this respect . i would prefer this renunciation not to dispel the idea that we have a common need to serve the united nation & apos ; peace-keeping mission , and to begin , at least , to equip ourselves with the intellectual resource of common security think before we draw any conclusion from it about defence . certainly in scotland that have be a bone of contention . still more need to be do to ensure that high quality job be accessible to all to start with , but poverty reduction have to go well beyond question of employment . what do the person who think up this name have in mind ? the council remind the member that the decision on the number of migrant worker to admit fall within the remit of each eu member state , and i would add that it will continue to remain within the remit of each member state even after the constitution come into force . i think it timely that the report point out that there be no evidence that europe be immune to such dramatic crisis . be there any comment ? mixed reaction there be no reason to block aid to its neighbour . our next objective be to resolve the cyprus question , an objective which , unfortunately , we be unable to achieve prior to integration . the new directive seek to go far by wide liberalization of the condition under which lawyer can practise in all european union country . eur 50 million be the sum advance by the council of minister at the height of the portuguese crisis , and this sum equal the value of national contribution to the restructuring of various community programme already mention by the commissioner . thus , operator will not be use up their resource look for loophole ; instead , they will be seek way to effectively implement the objective . we table an amendment to precisely that effect in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , but unfortunately it be in vain . the forthcoming turn of the century will be a decisive event for europe . mr gauzès refer to the growth and stability pact . we advocate equal treatment for all country , and cuba be certainly not benefit from the same treatment as other country . the decision which we have to take today be not a trivial one . we thus decide to launch infringement proceeding again spain on this issue . from these two perspective , the european parliament & apos ; s proposal be therefore a compromise , provide scope for further necessary change in the future . cooperation in the field of criminal and civil law establish the principle of mutual recognition as the crux of the strategy . thank you for your answer , which it be also very nice to have in swedish . otherwise , by fund the lukashenko regime , we will be responsible for it . ( e ) mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman , as the european commission state in its communication of 22 july , the situation in the dairy farming sector have deteriorate dramatically during the last 12 month . let us avoid excessive diversion , but let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater , or seek scapegoat for problem that be not cause by technological change or variation in demand , but by speculative movement that the world should not allow and that we , together with all political force , should fight against . the four northern regional council the baltic , barents , nordic and arctic council be important actor in this dialogue . the reason often stem from difference in term of opportunity , access to service and material resource , as well as from different life choice make by individual . you must insist that israel stop the killing . my report therefore call on the council of minister to establish common minimal law and penalty to counter terrorist act , to abolish formal extradition procedure for those suspect or convict of terrorist crime and to establish a european search and arrest warrant in the fight against terrorist group . but despite that , you remain firm in your democratic fight for the right of your people , reject the offer of a pardon you be make for health reason . this be emphasised very strongly in the report . in this regard , it be significant that the vice-president be to be giuliano amato , who be a member of the italian and european left but , most importantly , an advocate of that oligarchic desire to have the institution run just by a few aristocrat , by a small , unelected elite . how much long will parliament feel oblige to express its confidence in this way , while wait for an eventual sem 2000 ? in conclusion , i believe that much can be learn from an exchange of view between member state on energy policy , and i support mr chichester & apos ; s call for the commission to highlight example of best practice in integrate environmental objective in the energy policy . i move that this amendment be adopt , so that we can dispense with a second reading of this proposal for a regulation , otherwise the regulation , which be already overdue , could not enter into force in good time . responsible policy design to combat climate change be not base on a deindustrialisation of europe but on the viability of europe as an industrial location , and on industry in europe which produce without harm the environment and which export environmental protection . nevertheless , i do not think i should comment on the style and choice of word in a censorious way , because i would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement . what be certain be that no wholly military solution be possible in afghanistan . for the former , the committee set aside eur 181 million , with eur 600 million be set aside for the latter . now , we must bring about an export ban that enter into force before this . otherwise , the chlor-alkali industry , which have the large stock of mercury in europe , will export huge quantity of it . mr esteve have present a well-balanced document which be certainly positive whilst also take account of all the suggestion make by the various group president daul explain this by mean of a letter to commissioner fisher-boel . why do young people face so much unemployment and precariousness ? for all these reason , i vote in favour of the text negotiate with the council in order to reach agreement at second reading . every effort must be make to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their love one . i support the proposal that set-aside be fix at 5 % for the 1998 harvest but without reduce payment for land take out of production . there be obviously still shortcoming . what do you think of the presence of 11 representative from national central bank of the euro area on the economic and financial committee ? for five year ireland have enjoy an average growth of 5 % , with unemployment down from over 16 % to scarcely 4 % and a budget surplus of over 4.5 % . this constitute a reversal of the burden of proof . i must point out that these country have not meet all the deficit criterion . i think however that this expert group on financial education should have clear responsibility and power . the other institution , too , be work hard to ensure that the effect of enlargement be iron out , and we can not wait for these adjustment until 2004 . trade can be an important part of a long-term economic solution for pakistan . do the minister agree that no matter how many year before tibet regain its freedom , no european state should recognise the illegal action by the chinese government in tibet and that the transfer of ten of thousand of non-tibetan people into amdo be illegal under international law ? mr president , item 11 of yesterday & apos ; s minute refers to a speech i make under rule 121 ( a ) of the rule of procedure . fourthly and lastly the efficiency of public funding for risk capital activity must be improve and it be important that public funding should not crowd out private sector investment . now , we know the obsession of the commission chair by mr barroso with have these impact assessment carry out regularly as part of good regulation , which it use as a roadmap . i therefore call on you to adopt this report , and i also ask commissioner frattini to do so on behalf of the citizen of europe . this be also one of those rare liberalisation directive which fail to specify this aspect in a detailed manner . in other word , if we fail in a future debate to give region and nation a place in europe , we in fact further separatism . mr president , lady and gentleman , our financial forecast for the year 2000 to 2006 , upon which our cohesion policy depend , will be decide in march next year , accord to the cardiff summit , after the effect of the german election have be put into perspective . in my opinion , the lampedusa issueshould not have be mark down for debate because it be a matter of bilateral agreement between italy and libya and the enforcement of italian law that do not contravene the eu treaty . would the commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a european union agency , under its control , which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agency in our member state in the field of communicable disease ? if we can reach agreement on this point , then i think we will have solve the problem . so that the canadian and european market will become more competitive and more secure , and so that product-approval procedure will become short and simpler , i be vote in favour of the proposal in question . i would stress that not all food can or will be irradiate . it have show a willingness to look at other area also . the commission have already determine other substance ; as mr doyle say , they be confine to three and , as far as i know , this have not change since . the increased power of a transnational financial capitalism in which capital movement and speculation be more important than real trade in good be cause serious imbalance , chaos and crisis , while inequality between and within country be increase . it have not just list one human right violation after another in a give country but have adopt a comprehensive approach and policy , which the council very much appreciates . and what be more , if justice be to be implement efficiently and with respect for the right of individual it must also remain close to the people . they have the ambition and the capacity to grow and to become the & apos ; star & apos ; of tomorrow . this statute do not yet confer european legal personality , but the financing see us take the first step , with the second step , in the form of an actual european statute , perhaps yet to come . by that , be you say that you would be prepare to make great use of some of the dairy management tool that be at your disposal , such as export refund , aid to private storage and intervention ? yesterday there be a disgraceful communist demonstration in the courtyard of the tower . we have to do more in the fight against terrorism , but without suppress the right of those under investigation and those who have be charge . do the commission regard prime minister tariceanu ’ s concession to give romanian farmer financial help with the purchase of tractor from the factory in brasov as an infringement of the eu ’ s competition directive ? what be the commission & apos ; s current view of the scientific and political debate in spain over the estimate of the minimum ecological flow of the ebro river to its delta after the ebro transfer ? we need to make sure that they be implement by everyone . sadly , i consider that the only way to keep drug away from sportsman be to decommercialise sport . it have just be reveal that the minister for agriculture from his party in the united kingdom have not even be in dialogue with his opposite number in france , which be ridiculous when you consider the way temper be get raise in the process of this trade war . accession to this area would be open to surround country that fulfil the basic copenhagen criterion of be democratic , have market economy and respect human right . the doha development round be not worthy of its name . i would , therefore , invite parliament to continue to support the transfer of the administrative aspect of custom cooperation which be currently under title 6 of the treaty from the third pillar to the community & apos ; s sphere . as you will realise , that be a binding statement , commit the united state to a certain kind of conduct . we can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerge country , china in particular , which be win contract with rock-bottom price in the country of the union , without regard for social right and legislation on state aid , whereas the market of these country remain inaccessible to european company . i doubt whether i would be within my right to ask the national parliament of our partner country to respond to the country strategy paper . today & apos ; s debate in this assembly have show that parliament and the commission be to a large extent agree on how the battle should be fight . all three institution will need to show goodwill and make sacrifice and compromise if this arrangement be to work , but it be a prize well worth fight for because the single market in security will yield many benefit for the people we be elect to represent . the united state , in a different context , have be refer to the currency situation in china , namely the chinese peg , which unite state commentator be say be compound the situation regard export from china . mr president , mr kallas , mr lópez garrido , in this case , we have see that nature really be more powerful than any of the technology available to us . it be the result of a construction in which the member state and the commission bear the main responsibility : the maastricht criterion in the stability and growth pact - which have of course already be water down under commissioner almunia & apos ; s leadership - the deficit procedure , the clear statistical data and the independence of the european central bank . in order to counter the proliferation of refusal of approval , it would be of great assistance if the court of auditor be to publish them in future in its annual report . it be asymmetric , limited to a few rare sector , such as transport , communication and finance and in fact only concern the oecd country plus a dozen more or less developing country , whereas the majority of third world country remain under-developed . a mistake have nonetheless creep into our opinion . he be now dead , and what the opposition , the democratic movement , be call for be that we should take economic sanction . when we point out area in which kosovo & apos ; s leader need to improve , for example with regard to the protection of minority , this be because we be serious when we say that we will stand by kosovo in its effort to create a democratic society . a democratic society with respect for minority , coexist peacefully with its neighbouring country . therefore we can agree to the amendment propose by parliament that certain firework do not fall under the directive if they be produce by manufacturer for their own use and if their use by the manufacturer himself have be approve by the respective member state . some would say : & apos ; so what ? i think that a functioning european farming industry and a functioning european ecosystem need suitable support for our beekeeper , which be why i ask the house to throw its full weight behind the lull report . may i also thank commissioner špidla for be here today in place of commissioner figeľ , who be travel outside europe . that need to be decide in the release directive . it be illogical to deplore the closure of a renault work while accept total liberalization elsewhere . mr president , on a point of order and to clarify what i say earlier on , during the vote on the period of reflection , in the split vote relate to paragraph 2 of amendment 2 , you request a roll-call vote but then change your mind and say the first part of that split vote would be check . people take part in aviation sport in austria and in other member state be confront with the fact that vitally important set of rule for such sport be only available in english . for the rest , colleague on the board of the fund take the same view . the immediate measure be those propose by the commission for the 1996 , 1997 and 1998 wine year , but they be merely a stopgap . the reference to state aid for purpose of general interest and in the public good at european union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the member state , but also prejudge that such a procedure will far strengthen this asymmetrical development by increase inequality and injustice . i have no answer to your specific question as to how that matter be conclude , but i nevertheless believe that wrong remain wrong . in this context , i would indeed welcome what you say in paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution , namely that policy must remain base on article 85 . the minister decide in pörtschach to schedule a meeting in tampere in the second half of the year , which will help focus strong attention on internal security in the year 1999 . in the commission report of 14 march this year , ( com ( 2000 ) 147 ) , the commission refers specifically to the development of some kind of cooperation system between the outermost region and the acp country . you can not call on the commissioner to stand firm on issue that be not entirely within his control . i be think of the european external action service . unfortunately , over the past couple of week , the council have clearly state that it be not prepared to adopt draft amendment from the second reading . we should call for the release of vietnamese political prisoner who have be imprison because they have legally and peacefully exercise their freedom of opinion , press and religion . at this point i should therefore like to thank all of those who give time , patience , energy and love and make sacrifice for those who need their help . another important point in the agreement be that business themselves will have to pay their invoice within 60 day , unless agree otherwise between the party on term that be not unfair to the creditor . could you please confirm that jean-marie le pen , a member of this house , have indeed receive the selection of instrument from the treaty which include the joint declaration on racism and xenophobia of 11 june 1986 ? china be a new emerge power , and we do not want to prevent that , but we object to a form of nationalism that be develop a certain degree of aggressiveness , particularly in that region in asia . it seem to me that , in a healthy democracy , there can be the opportunity to vote . that be what i believe , and i be not offend parliament when i tell it to reach a verdict , while i perhaps regret the fact that this procedure do not allow it to reach a verdict on a text that have be improve – i have no hesitation in say this – by the committee . let this happy intermission be an example to us ; it show us that europe and the entire world can understand difference in a climate of equality , harmony and mutual respect . the uncertainty could have lead project manager to interrupt the running of operational programme , which have to be avoid at all cost . as the united state be now at the forefront of clinical and pharmacological research , it have become a model of contemporary society in several respect . that country have have extremely successful legislation on orphan medicinal product since 1983 . people who be really persecute be refuse the status of refugee , on the ground that their persecutor be not government agent , and the council ratify this restrictive interpretation in a resolution of march 1996 . we do not envisage opposition to reform the main policy on expenditure . rather , it be a case of stress the importance of keep to the agree timetable , and therefore follow a different course from that set for the enlargement negotiation . what be vital now be that million of refugee should be help to return to live condition worthy of human being , to provide themselves with the basic necessity of life , which mean not just food and drinking water , demining and the return of land to its owner , but most of all ensure their physical security . mr president-in-office of the council , you will find it more difficult to achieve the necessary compromise at european level if the mood within germany be different . i think that the age limit of 25 should be raise to 30 and that the age limit for old employee should be drop from 55 to 50 , because society relies on both , young people enter employment and old people remain in employment . the additionality rule can be meet in various way and yet the government have do nothing . let us give it another name , because it resonate with other implication . this be also true of the contribution to environmental organisation . nor should we forget the mediterranean aspect of the union , the investment in the fruit and vegetable sector which will have to compete with the substantial need for economic aid of large country dependent on agriculture . the quality of intervention within the framework of community aid depend on the strategy and idea of the member state . the people have be bypass , but then the european union be very good at bypass the people . the amendment we have table emphasise our opposition and the basis of principle which lead us to reject any attempt to create a situation in which the management of pension fund reserve be liberalise and uncontrolled , leave their asset to be gamble away on the stock market . it have not , however , be demonstrate , and still less proved , that the most suitable and effective method of cop with these breach of the law be to set up a further european agency or common eu coastguard . how should the challenge of the future be tackle ? the money that be available should be spend on the need of our 375 million people and on the protection of our environment , not on the european parliament as an institution . i think we need to remain very aware of that when we make a balanced assessment of our negotiation with turkey . i want to highlight two of these point here . i do not intend to list these in detail at the moment ; we can do that at the second reading . in the framework of the work carry out on this directive , we now await the initiative of the commission and the discussion in council so that this error can be rectify . commitment to education should not be see as a cost , but rather as an investment in the future . with large vessel it be often possible to put out to sea on more day , and sometimes that do not result in great tonnage , but do lead to more actual fishing . as a forward-thinking european , you guide portugal with a sure hand on the road to european union membership . one person say that it be fortunate that no referendum be to take place , for in that case it would also fail to be adopt in his own country , portugal . on the one hand , there be the rule that since the entry into force of the amsterdam treaty in 1999 the council have be responsible for establish the rule on eu visa policy . in several chapter the court criticize the management of community subsidy . the absence of european patent legislation , for instance , be a hindrance for small business in particular to make the most of the opportunity of the internal market . small business do not have the necessary resource to register their new development . i would like to stress the need to invest great effort in disaster risk reduction and to provide support - in addition to one-off aid - for community & apos ; own disaster-preparedness capability . the first be that the commission should make it possible for the council to put forward a support regulation for euro-4 to parliament without the risk of accusation of state support . as far as technology be concern , there be still more to do . it be not just to please the european union and ensure that it become a member . a journalist from the most influential newspaper in poland ask me , & apos ; what do you people do in the european parliament ? the next item be the debate on six motion for resolution on togo ( 1 ) . i be aware of the need to be sensitive as regard national procedural rule . amendment nos 7 , 8 and 15 do not precisely correspond to the objective of the proposal and , therefore , it be not appropriate to accept them . the information must be show prominently on the label , not in tiny letter in the list of ingredient . i think that a useful addition by parliament and even the commission be in agreement with it . the final matter concern security . as i indicate earlier , that be not the case ; i react while i be there and the commission respond well to this issue . as the social democrat group , we be right behind the rapporteur and also vote in favour in the committee as a result of our conviction on the matter . the eu must make it quite clear that while we may have different opinion on other issue and still carry on with the agenda , this specific topic be a priority for the eu . there be some issue raise in the debate that i will not comment on individually at this time because they be of a very specific and organisational nature , and i believe that each and every one of them be worthy of an expert assessment as to its merit . aid for research , innovation and education be an essential measure for ensure a labour market for all . in this context , it be clear to me that palestine must be a viable state , and that we will therefore have to continue to provide humanitarian aid . among the very many thought express , i add my own two in favour of the experiment . i be of the firm conviction that , give the colonial history of these country , europe have a major obligation to this region . there be three finno-ugric nation state in the european union , and in addition there be three million people represent the finno-ugric nation in russia . monetary union be the final cornerstone of economic integration . our group would therefore like to keep the debate and vote on oral question and motion for resolution in one part-session , and put the association agreement back to another part-session . now , after an eclipse that have last for many decade , italy can contribute towards the future of the union with an appropriate role . we have to rely to a certain extent on parliamentary fair play . more often , however , state aid have be a mean of protect weak region , disadvantage professional group and vital public service , or of protect society against the effect of major economic crisis . in write . - conservative meps abstain on the final vote on the mănescu report for the following reason . the discussion on reproductive health and right dominate the last day of the summit . the european union need – by which i mean that the member state need – to take action , action in the form of information campaign aim in particular at the victim , but also in the exist structure , such as the establishment where police officer , social worker and the judiciary be train and in similar place , along with more cooperation with ngo and the executive . certainly we want to see european harmonisation in the area of damage cause to the environment , which be often cross-border in nature , but it be also necessary that the directive should represent serious progress . finally , i hope that the member state respect the mandate of the intergovernmental conference to put the matter of legal immigration to qualify majority voting and to codecision . if , as it have be ask to do in european parliament resolution , turkey really want to help resolve the cyprus problem on the basis of the un secretary-general & apos ; s most recent plan , then it will start back off in its foreign policy as well . if this policy remain unchanged so will the state of affair , and the situation in town centre will steadily worsen . first of all , we think a policy should set itself objective that lend it significance , like the development of a sound european industrial base , increase employment , especially for young people , and the emergence of european industrial champion able to act as standard bearer for the ‘ make in europe ’ brand . in 1996 when the new socialist government come to power in portugal , policy change , madrid move into line and , at the dublin council , the european union approve the new emphasis on multimodal transport with which we happen to agree .
