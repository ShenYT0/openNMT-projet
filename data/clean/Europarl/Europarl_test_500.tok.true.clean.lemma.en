we know , however , that there be still many obstacle which need to be overcome in order to reach agreement , particularly in matter relate to it independence and jurisdiction .
I would dwell at length on what be the guide principle of this proposal , but I shall limit myself to consider growth and employment .
although this process of establish the internal market in service be very important for Europe ’ s economic development , the rule ensure European social cohesion must be comply with .
sideline this section of the debate once again will not help u , in my opinion , to break the deadlock .

moreover , even if it be important for many authority to collect revenue for the information it produce when it be be use for commercial purpose , it be important that our citizen can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own life and health without have to pay for it .
it be very much in the spirit of the entente cordiale .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I should now like to focus on the specific lesson that I have draw from this affair , and set out some proposal which , I hope , will correspond to your recommendation for the future .

Mr President , it seem to me that we need to distinguish two aspiration which be contain in the Galeote report and which to some extent lead in different direction .
but we must go far and be more ambitious .
an important step forward .
that be why these objective be more important than ever .
let me refer , by way of example , to Mr Khanbhai & apos ; s report , which reveal some problem in the ECSC account , include , among other thing , the solvency ratio and the transfer of property , although the Commission and the High Authority be currently reduce these problem with a view to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002 .

in fact , the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt , which reach 7.1 % of GDP in 2001 - and be estimate a 4 % of GDP in 2002 - meant that the evolution of the debt ratio do not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administration , the achievement of increasingly high primary surplus or the growth in GDP .

we now need to build on that hope together .
a the House will know and a have be remark again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential election early this year result in the change of government in Croatia and bring a new political climate .

everyone know how crucial and burn this issue be , with the partisan of prohibition and the tenant of an & apos ; alternative policy & apos ; often pole apart .
Mr President , let me thank Commissioner Papoutsis , because I think he have take some important initiative which go beyond mere word and extend to the promotion of practical measure , no matter how difficult they may be and how many obstacle have to be overcome .

nevertheless , I wish to stress once again that economic hardship can not serve a a pretext for undemocratic behaviour .
a some of you may already know , there be a leaked document on the future of the common agricultural policy towards 2020 , which also address the territorial challenge of the future .

the Commission will far investigate specific requirement for LPG combustion heater to be add in Annex VIII .
it should respect the law and the rule , and immediately declare that further ratification of the now dead Lisbon Treaty be a completely useless exercise .

but she be present , there she be .
as long a there be due consideration for the environment , the EU & apos ; s objective should be to abolish all subsidy and to place farmer and food producer on an equal footing with other manufacturer and business in the Union .

with new legislative proposal , we should not be push to provide opinion and report at breakneck speed which allow u little time for thought and consultation with interest group and citizen .
I would like to inform the House that , a rapporteur , I support the amendment table by the socialist but can not accept the PPE and the GUE / NGL amendment . I will give my reason for that .
congratulation to all the rapporteur on their work .

the Commission have provide no fact whatsoever to demonstrate why it be necessary ; instead we be refer to a theoretical danger .

I hope that I be not right , but if we go on like this , perhaps we should join in a chorus of & quot ; nearer my God to Thee & quot ; , stand in the middle and sing it .
for this reason , we have to support a UN-led solution that be a prompt and peaceful a possible .

Russia appear to be an essential partner in seek this lasting solution to the crisis in Kosovo .
what be hard to take in this whole situation be the fact that this reflect the relationship between the EU and Russia .
towards a common European foreign policy on energy ( debate )
my fellow Member from Greece , Mrs Rapti , mention that there be political undertone behind the desire to amalgamate agency , and she say that we must not interfere with agency in Greece .
no one in Europe have lose their identity but , and this be the important point , make them work together in their substantial common interest which be social and economic , a I often say & apos ; spill their sweat and not their blood & apos ; , and by do that we can breakdown the barrier and century and the new Europe will have evolve .
lastly , I welcome the proposal that Structural Funds should be use to support R & # 91 ; amp & # 93 ; D action at regional level and a ‘ European excellence label ’ .
Mr President , my group would also like to express it condolence to those involve in the Samina Express disaster .
Western company continue to exploit their patent monopoly on technique and crop , development cooperation focus too little on agriculture and technological expertise be not pass on .

I can not imagine that we would bring toys into circulation which claim 5 million victim annually .
discussion on debt relief for the country seriously affect by the disaster in the Indian Ocean be go on in Paris .
the vote will be take tomorrow at 12 noon .
look at from that angle , it be good and necessary that the Commission want to do some repair and so attaches primary importance to the transport facility have great and good interoperability and intermodality and intend to see to it that the candidate country be well interconnect , tie in and involve .
when we speak about a competitive market , again interconnection be an absolute necessity .

this House have actually press for that .

nor can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 23 , 24 and 25 .
one of these amendment propose the implementation and application of the policy of the financial instrument for fishery .
so besides adopt specific resolution - and there be clearly no objection to that , which be why we be debate it here - , perhaps we ought in future to examine another more effective way not just of express solidarity but of become more effective in substance .
the three report outline several possible direction of work in this respect .
I would prefer this renunciation not to dispel the idea that we have a common need to serve the United Nations & apos ; peace-keeping mission , and to begin , at least , to equip ourselves with the intellectual resource of common security think before we draw any conclusion from it about defence .
certainly in Scotland that have be a bone of contention .

what do the person who think up this name have in mind ?
the Council remind the Member that the decision on the number of migrant worker to admit fall within the remit of each EU Member State , and I would add that it will continue to remain within the remit of each Member State even after the Constitution come into force .
I think it timely that the report point out that there be no evidence that Europe be immune to such dramatic crisis .
be there any comment ?
mixed reaction
there be no reason to block aid to it neighbour .
our next objective be to resolve the Cyprus question , an objective which , unfortunately , we be unable to achieve prior to integration .
the new Directive seek to go far by wide liberalization of the condition under which lawyer can practise in all European Union country .
EUR 50 million be the sum advance by the Council of Ministers at the height of the Portuguese crisis , and this sum equal the value of national contribution to the restructuring of various Community programme already mention by the Commissioner .
thus , operator will not be use up their resource look for loophole ; instead , they will be seek way to effectively implement the objective .

the forthcoming turn of the century will be a decisive event for Europe .

in this regard , it be significant that the vice-president be to be Giuliano Amato , who be a member of the Italian and European left but , most importantly , an advocate of that oligarchic desire to have the institution run just by a few aristocrat , by a small , unelected elite .
