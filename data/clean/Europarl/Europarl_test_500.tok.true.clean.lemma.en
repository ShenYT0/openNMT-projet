I see far faster movement in the economic and internal market sphere than in the social sphere and there are real danger of a growing imbalance in that respect .
we know , however , that there are still many obstacle which need to be overcome in order to reach agreement , particularly in matter relating to it independence and jurisdiction .
I would dwell at length on what are the guiding principle of this proposal , but I shall limit myself to considering growth and employment .
although this process of establishing the internal market in service is very important for Europe ’ s economic development , the rule ensuring European social cohesion must be complied with .
sidelining this section of the debate once again will not help u , in my opinion , to break the deadlock .
Mr Commissioner , you have primarily concentrated on the logistical and technical aspect , and you have only just begun to touch on the monetary risk that could ensue from what you call the gigantic holding by foreigner of German mark but also presumably of other euro zone currency .
this mean that the European Parliament must develop effective instrument so that it can exert control over the application of the programme , a well a proper budgetary management .
the necessary information on each Member State must be made available so a to increase the effectiveness of control and monitoring system , and to ensure that we have a true picture of the situation .
one thing is certain , one thing which I have learned in the course of my contact with country which , only recently , were suffering under communist dictatorship : those country cannot emerge unaided .
Mr President , I am sorry that almost no Members of the elected European Commission are present .
Member of the Commission . - Everyone in this Chamber will know that the Commission ha been a very strong and present partner in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland for year .
this company ha deliberately not paid it employee the money owing to them , either in full – I have statement that this ha occurred – or in part .
that is the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you , Commissioner – on various minimum size , which we would have liked to fix more decisively : sardine and cod caught in the northern sea do not have the same rate of biological growth a the fish fauna of the Mediterranean .
I would like to mention that the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights obviously will not resolve the problem of the European Court of Human Rights being completely overloaded with work .
amendments Nos 2 , 4 and 14 should in fact be set aside in favour of Amendment No 21 , which is intended to promote the safe handling of these material so a to avoid serious environmental consequence .
we are all right behind you .
it is also interesting to note that CFSP will not really mean &apos; common foreign and security policy &apos; a long a it is totally off-limits to discus , within the framework of our foreign policy cooperation , what two of the Member States of this Union are doing in the UN Security Council .
I would , however , urge them to read the text carefully .
we must fight torture , terrorism and every crime against humanity .
does Europe really not have the authority to say to Israel ‘ It is time to end the Israeli military occupation ’ ?
that is why Labour Euro MPs voted against call for a 5 % budget increase .
since that occasion in April 2003 there ha been a considerable amount of effort , discussion and negotiation on the part of Parliament and the Council in order to arrive at the compromise before you today .
to bridge this gap , however , the European People &apos;s Party doe not believe the solution lie in adopting a comprehensive directive that would be difficult to implement and inefficient .
Commissioner , please ensure that , if there is an avian flu jab , it will be mercury-free .
there are nine other applicant country - if I leave aside Cyprus and Malta where it is presumably easier to control the border - so we have ten applicant country , all with problem like this , without enough money to meet the cost .
in addition , I would like to underline another important factor mentioned in the relevant report which is that the conclusion of these agreement will imply a considerable financial burden for Macedonia and other Western Balkan country .
the French Government ha initiated a discussion and made proposal to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flag of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection .
the first month have given u only a vague picture of the intention of the authority in Minsk .
finally , we should be able to quickly draw the consequence of a piece of legislation , the implementation of which creates more problem than it solves .
moreover , even if it is important for many authority to collect revenue for the information it produce when it is being used for commercial purpose , it is important that our citizen can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own life and health without having to pay for it .
it wa very much in the spirit of the entente cordiale .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I should now like to focus on the specific lesson that I have drawn from this affair , and set out some proposal which , I hope , will correspond to your recommendation for the future .
in short , we shall vote in favour of the Brinkhorst report , a I said , despite our doubt a to how effective a weapon this will be against the Council .
this would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another see it number peak .
Fitzsimons recommendation ( A4-0052 / 99 )
it is about time we put more ethanol in petrol , and with the new decision we will at least have half the rate that Brazil ha .
on behalf of my group I should like to say that my group congratulates Mr Verde i Aldea for his report .
unfortunately , recent statement from some people do not encourage optimism .
the problem of mobility pose a multitude of risk , however .
is it an attempt to move closer towards the Syrian and Libyan dictatorship , which are constantly violating human right ?
the second area which I believe should be a particular priority for u is the development of intercultural relation .
indeed , over the last year and a half in particular , bloody terrorist brutality ha shaken the entire world .
the draft budget envisages a drastic reduction in the appropriation allocated to this line .
obviously , that everything possible should be done to obtain a cease-fire within the framework of a regional conference for peace , security and stability in the region , which could be held under the aegis of the UN and the OAU .
the European Structural Funds grant the local and regional authority and the social player extensive right of participation .
with regard to Honduras , I would remind you that the Honduras army is in multinational hand , and that when the Honduras tax authority wish to levy tax on a crate of banana , they are forbidden to do so .
we welcome President Khatami &apos;s intervention , the action of lecturer and student in protesting and Dr Aghajari &apos;s own appeal for calm .
Mr President , I greatly welcome the ARGO action programme .
we should be giving the country that are about to join u a sheaf of unambiguous and harmonised regulation that they know they can stick to and be guided by .
I will concentrate on two area .
this ha attracted the support of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and of Parliament .
just ask journalist in Brussels , for example .
the people there are now trying , especially in Tunisia and Egypt , to build new country - democratic country where there is respect for fundamental right and the rule of law .
Mr President , the symbol of the Red Cross / Red Crescent movement brings hope to battlefield worldwide .
Mr President , it seems to me that we need to distinguish two aspiration which are contained in the Galeote report and which to some extent lead in different direction .
but we must go further and be more ambitious .
an important step forward .
that is why these objective are more important than ever .
let me refer , by way of example , to Mr Khanbhai &apos; s report , which revealed some problem in the ECSC account , including , among other thing , the solvency ratio and the transfer of property , although the Commission and the High Authority are currently reducing these problem with a view to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002 .
I am quite simply stating the political reality , which is not very positive , and I strongly urge the Council to draw lesson from this negative situation and ensure that , the next time the Treaties are reviewed , the structure are changed , a the current shortcoming of the institution are preventing u from doing good .
I know that I have by no mean covered all our foreign policy area , but I should like to conclude with a few thought on the changing nature of European integration .
I would draw Parliament &apos; s attention to the fact that this is indeed a natural disaster for these flood and this rain were twenty time greater than normal .
indeed , a he say , we have reached a very satisfactory outcome .
by way of conclusion , I should like to say that the situation seems to be improving , although a very great deal remains to be done .
if we are to believe the rapporteur , the risk from uncontrolled use of herbal medicine are considerable .
in fact , the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt , which reached 7.1 % of GDP in 2001 - and is estimated a 4 % of GDP in 2002 - meant that the evolution of the debt ratio doe not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administration , the achievement of increasingly high primary surplus or the growth in GDP .
to sum up , for all the reason I have given , I do not think it is acceptable to allow the citizen to shoulder all the responsibility .
we now need to build on that hope together .
as the House will know and a ha been remarked again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential election early this year resulted in the change of government in Croatia and brought a new political climate .
a few other MEPs have already mentioned this topic , and we have also discussed it with the Commissioner within the framework of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy .
I am convinced that this wa the main reason for the declaration by the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine , Mrs Kalay-Kleitman , who stated in an interview with the Serkalo Nedeli that Israel cannot recognise the Holodomor a an act of ethnic genocide .
it is ha also played a crucial role in easing sectarian tension and bridging the division between the two tradition on the island .
we consider that the limit on TAC change should be plus or minus 15 % to be in accordance with scientific advice .
that is the signal .
the Committee on Legal Affairs look at this issue through legal spectacle , a you would expect .
Mr President , I wa just about to say that the issue of information is also fundamental .
nor do I believe that it make sense to wire the whole Parliament and install a wireless LAN in all the building ; these are not our core task in this connection .
a legal basis must therefore be decided at the intergovernmental conference in order to enable the Council to vote by qualified majority , no longer unanimously , within the social sphere .
they are doing a good job and need to know that they can sign contract for building and pay salary for next year .
Mr President , we see more and more every day how a common European immigration policy ha become essential .
at this point , I welcome Mr Patten &apos; s commitment to transparency in the use of European aid .
the other hurdle that you must surmount is the paucity of public preparedness .
she is a very fine example of how a rapporteur should behave in conducting Parliament &apos;s business and committee business .
if we want to make a go of multilateralism , then we ourselves need to set an example , be consistent and show how well it can work in the future , because the IMF ha an absolutely crucial role to play in the field of global governance , a role that transcends the issue of European debt and of the sovereign debt situation of the European country that are struggling .
everyone know how crucial and burning this issue is , with the partisan of prohibition and the tenant of an &apos; alternative policy &apos; often pole apart .
Mr President , let me thank Commissioner Papoutsis , because I think he ha taken some important initiative which go beyond mere word and extend to the promotion of practical measure , no matter how difficult they may be and how many obstacle have to be overcome .
firstly , there is broad consensus about the European Union &apos;s ability , within the NATO framework , to defend itself against any conceivable aggressor , whether this be done together with our ally , or , if need be , independently .
we have not made sufficient reference to former debate we have had in relation to the severe problem that implementation of this legislation will entail for certain region such a small island and isolated mountain region .
specific directive will then be adopted within this framework .
interinstitutional cooperation should therefore become more vigorous in the future and the role of the European Parliament in particular should be made more prominent .
nevertheless , I wish to stress once again that economic hardship cannot serve a a pretext for undemocratic behaviour .
as some of you may already know , there is a leaked document on the future of the common agricultural policy towards 2020 , which also address the territorial challenge of the future .
it is therefore extremely important that the EU act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation , or WHO .
the so-called war veteran - they must have been very young when the war of independence wa on - have been paid to be on these farm .
Mr President , it would thus mean that if you know that all the protein originate from abroad , say from South America , that you will soon also need to label absolutely everything with GMO identification within the framework of this novel food directive .
the Commission will further investigate specific requirement for LPG combustion heater to be added in Annex VIII .
it should respect the law and the rule , and immediately declare that further ratification of the now dead Lisbon Treaty is a completely useless exercise .
I stress this point because , in point of fact , among the priority that have been indicated I can see three that meet this requirement of sustainable development for the men and woman living in those country .
but she is present , there she is .
as long a there is due consideration for the environment , the EU &apos;s objective should be to abolish all subsidy and to place farmer and food producer on an equal footing with other manufacturer and business in the Union .
. Mr President , this ha been a very useful , rather balanced and proportionate debate , but I well understand the huge anxiety and sensitivity that are excited by this issue of textile .
the decision to favour growing organic fodder legume alone ha not reassured the operator in this sector .
there may have been time when our instrument were slightly out of tune , but we have worked extremely well together .
the rule should be a easy a possible for these institution to use .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically .
but we do have serious reservation on two point .
in addition , we can accept two amendment if we alter the wording slightly .
one transnational civil protection mechanism may help in dealing with natural disaster .
in the light of the Commission &apos;s option a presented , we , like the rapporteur , take the view that the list should not be further extended at this stage .
question No 37 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis ( H-0324 / 02 ) :
the people who pay the bill are the customer of these company , who pay them in higher price and , above all , the people of Europe , who are priced out of job .
Mr President , Minister , I would like to ask if any decision of principle have been taken regarding whether there should be a mandate from the UN or any other international organisation in discharging such task a these , a , under international law , a mandate from an international organisation is needed before any country &apos; s territory can legally be attacked in this way .
we must therefore take action wherever there is a threat to the world &apos;s cultural heritage .
it is a remarkable dossier we are discussing here , a highly technical one .
code of Conduct for computerised reservation system ( debate )
in conclusion , we must achieve an effective control , application and notification system , a stated in recital A , but this system will inevitably require of the Member States a spirit of mutual trust and accountability and an equal commitment to notifying infringement securely and effectively .
as a result , the money of the fund will not be spent , and we will miss a major opportunity for development in eastern Europe .
I should like , if I may , to divide what I have to say into two part : the first providing a specific Commission response to the four report on the agenda , that is the Péry report , the two Arias Cañete report and the Kofoed report ; and a second in which I shall attempt to reply to more general issue raised here by many colleague and many honourable Members .
today , if we want to put a stop to these horror , it is necessary , before all else , to name the guilty party : Islam , which , like Communism , seek to use terrorism a a mean of imposing a totalitarian system .
after thirty year of being ignored , of silence and of broken promise , the time ha come for the world in general , and Europe in particular , to stop turning it back on the problem and to face it head on .
seven year after the Iranian regime tried to convince the Iranians and the international community that it wa open to change and to democratisation , it is now clear - to all the observer , and to the Iranian people first and foremost - that nothing ha changed for the better and no improvement in the human right situation or the democratic right ha taken place .
in our first action programme , eEurope 2002 , we had a special approach to e-transport , but it wa not , unfortunately , able to create sufficient interest among the Member States .
I thought that it wa a general rule in this House that if the Commission wish to speak out on something , it actually doe so .
the objective of adequate , safe and high quality food is a human requirement and demand of the worker which cannot be safeguarded within the framework of the capitalist method of production and trade in agricultural product .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , Angola is still suffering from war , destruction and the senseless , shocking loss of human life .
however , these shortcoming should not cloud the fact that an impressive job ha been done on the ground by the Agency &apos;s staff .
I believe that this really is a very significant issue and it is very important because it affect all the Members of a Parliament whose power , we must admit , have increased .
however , the Commission doe not consider that research involving embryo should be excluded a such from the Union &apos;s research programme , and just now I referred to the opportunity that such research can provide in very important sector .
I considered the report , which agrees with the conclusion of a Voluntary Partnership Agreement between Cameroon and the European Union , to be worthy of support during the vote .
we worked very hard with the Spanish Presidency in recent month .
in 2006 alone , Europe wa richer by EUR 240 billion , or the equivalent of EUR 518 for every European citizen because of the single market .

there is no room for fudge or lack of clarity .
the Spanish are the main beneficiary , with the Canaries where 91 % of the fleet is dependent on this agreement , and with Andalusia where 75 % of the fleet is involved , and there would be a cost to pay if there were to be no agreement .
( MT ) Mr President , it is a disgrace that , once again , so many people had to lose their life before the European Union &apos;s lack of concrete action on immigration wa exposed .
on hearing this you say : &apos; yes , of course that is quite right &apos; , but this appeal would in fact suggest that the European Union and the European Member States have been far too quick to seize their weapon in the past , in different context .
the spirit of Schengen is a spirit of trust and solidarity .
the amount proposed corresponds to 20 % of the appropriation for heading five and therefore respect the ceiling which the European Parliament itself set for 2001 .

Mrs Green spoke in favour of the resolution which wa put to this Chamber .
moreover , the Convention establishes no link with other Community database - some of which have already been mentioned , such a scent or IRENE - the database for the fight against fraud , or the IDA proposal to facilitate the smooth functioning of the single market .

this is why we are there and why we need to remain there .
first of all , the committee proposes taking into account the health of worker and consumer protection , by introducing the precautionary principle and the principle that the best available technology should be used so a to keep radiation a low a possible .

tobacco consumption must regularly decrease and production must continue to be limited to a constant tonnage of 351 000 gross tonne of European tobacco , between the proposed new COM and the present COM .
I say yes , and I believe that other honourable Members will share that view .
the EU must help our citizen who are in trouble a a result of the worldwide crisis .
it is another gradual step forward , definitely not backwards .
thus , we are certainly among those who offer the Czech Presidency particular support and do not intend to attach too much importance to teething problem - the rather one-sided initial position on the Gaza conflict and the Czech President &apos;s view that social and environmental standard are too high have already been mentioned .
besides , Parliament &apos; s passion for regulation , a borne out by so many amendment , will result in a regulation that is difficult to implement .

our task now is to continue working for the civil and custom protection of our geographical indication , which are damaged by competition which is at the very least unfair , due to the constant use of name and acronym that reference the best-known European brand .
it is also high time , I believe , that the Commission abandoned it blind belief in neo-liberalism and , instead of accepting a downward spiral of competitive deflation and fiscal dumping , changed course to return to and build on the idea of Brüning , to create a situation and a policy that would take u beyond Keynes .
are you proposing to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect ?
we hope that the European Parliament will become ever more involved in protecting these right and , above all , we are pleased to support the idea of continuous monitoring of all the legislative activity that will lead to such protection , which , a the Commissioner wa saying , could culminate in a final report .
the German Federal Government , our political party , social partner , employer &apos; and worker &apos; association , will not tolerate the planned restriction on our posting of worker legislation , and other European country have similar misgiving .

. – Mr President , first of all , of course , I must congratulate my group colleague Mr Seppänen on his outstanding report ; he is right to stress the primary responsibility that is incumbent on the Member States where the storage or processing of nuclear waste is concerned , and they certainly have one when it come to refusing to accept waste from outside their own border .
as the draftsman of the REX Committee , I have taken a look at the draft regulation and , like Mr virgin , I could only shake my head at some of the point proposed there .

we should also look at environmental and social policy and , when we talk of progress for these country , it is important that we do not simply measure , a the Commission often doe , growth in foreign investment and the economy , but that we also look at how far the country are able to incorporate aspect of the working environment and social policy into their competition policy .

( FI ) Madam President , I want to mention three matter very briefly .
in conclusion , I call on all my colleague to support this report and I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to you all to visit Cyprus in 2008 , to enjoy Cypriot hospitality and to spend your euro freely in the sun .
with new legislative proposal , we should not be pushed to provide opinion and report at breakneck speed which allow u little time for thought and consultation with interest group and citizen .
I would like to inform the House that , a rapporteur , I support the amendment tabled by the socialist but cannot accept the PPE and the GUE / NGL amendment . I will give my reason for that .
congratulations to all the rapporteur on their work .
the debate is closed .
the Commission ha provided no fact whatsoever to demonstrate why it is necessary ; instead we are referred to a theoretical danger .
I think we should do something about this .
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can answer you at least in part .
we will always be on the side of democracy and not of tyranny .
an agreement wa reached last weekend thanks to concession both from Member States and MEPs .
you can write anything you like on paper .
I hope that I am not right , but if we go on like this , perhaps we should join in a chorus of &quot; nearer my God to Thee &quot; , standing in the middle and singing it .
for this reason , we have to support a UN-led solution that is a prompt and peaceful a possible .
therefore , what sustainable development project is the Commission implementing for Niger ?
3 600 people dead , most of them civilian .
the case of Manuel Rosales only confirms what I am saying .
it is about time we discussed this shameful subject , addressed this inhumane phenomenon , and began to effectively counteract sexual assault in Haiti .
- ( FR ) At it meeting of 7 May 1999 , the European Parliament adopted the EU-Mexico Global Agreement even though none of it Members knew the term of negotiation of it trade aspect .
the paralogism of the past must stop .
almost a quarter of Romanian territory will become arid in the next 20 year and many plant specie will disappear .
subsequently , the introduction of a common European system for comparing fingerprint should be considered .
I believe that this is a very rigorous , very interesting and very well executed piece of work on a genuinely difficult subject .
actually , they have done something . they have massively financed their public postal service company and now , rationalised , financed , with enormous economic power , they intend to enter the rest of the European Union &apos; s postal service market .
Russia appears to be an essential partner in seeking this lasting solution to the crisis in Kosovo .
what is hard to take in this whole situation is the fact that this reflects the relationship between the EU and Russia .
towards a common European foreign policy on energy ( debate )
my fellow Member from Greece , Mrs Rapti , mentioned that there were political undertone behind the desire to amalgamate agency , and she said that we must not interfere with agency in Greece .
no one in Europe ha lost their identity but , and this is the important point , make them work together in their substantial common interest which are social and economic , a I often say &apos; spilling their sweat and not their blood &apos; , and by doing that we can breakdown the barrier and century and the new Europe will have evolved .
lastly , I welcome the proposal that Structural Funds should be used to support R &#91; amp &#93; D action at regional level and a ‘ European excellence label ’ .
Mr President , my group would also like to express it condolence to those involved in the Samina Express disaster .
Western company continue to exploit their patent monopoly on technique and crop , development cooperation focus too little on agriculture and technological expertise is not passed on .
I hope that the Member States will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealing with it .
I cannot imagine that we would bring toy into circulation which claim 5 million victim annually .
discussions on debt relief for the country seriously affected by the disaster in the Indian Ocean are going on in Paris .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
looked at from that angle , it is good and necessary that the Commission want to do some repair and so attache primary importance to the transport facility having greater and better interoperability and intermodality and intends to see to it that the candidate country are better interconnected , tied in and involved .
when we speak about a competitive market , again interconnection is an absolute necessity .
meanwhile , it is becoming understood that a greater reliance ha to be placed on a sustainable model of production and consumption , and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resource .
this House had actually pressed for that .
is that the case ?
Milosevic did not in fact set in motion his devilish machinery to wipe out a whole people at the moment when NATO started bombing .
nor can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 23 , 24 and 25 .
one of these amendment proposes the implementation and application of the policy of the financial instrument for fishery .
so besides adopting specific resolution - and there are clearly no objection to that , which is why we are debating it here - , perhaps we ought in future to examine another more effective way not just of expressing solidarity but of becoming more effective in substance .
the three report outline several possible direction of work in this respect .
I would prefer this renunciation not to dispel the idea that we have a common need to serve the United Nations &apos; peace-keeping mission , and to begin , at least , to equip ourselves with the intellectual resource of common security thinking before we draw any conclusion from it about defence .
certainly in Scotland that ha been a bone of contention .
still more need to be done to ensure that high quality job are accessible to all to start with , but poverty reduction ha to go well beyond question of employment .
what did the person who thought up this name have in mind ?
the Council reminds the Member that the decision on the number of migrant worker to admit fall within the remit of each EU Member State , and I would add that it will continue to remain within the remit of each Member State even after the Constitution come into force .
I think it timely that the report point out that there is no evidence that Europe is immune to such dramatic crisis .
are there any comment ?
mixed reactions
there is no reason to block aid to it neighbour .
our next objective is to resolve the Cyprus question , an objective which , unfortunately , we were unable to achieve prior to integration .
the new Directive seek to go further by wider liberalization of the condition under which lawyer can practise in all European Union country .
EUR 50 million is the sum advanced by the Council of Ministers at the height of the Portuguese crisis , and this sum equal the value of national contribution to the restructuring of various Community programme already mentioned by the Commissioner .
thus , operator will not be using up their resource looking for loophole ; instead , they will be seeking way to effectively implement the objective .
we tabled an amendment to precisely that effect in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , but unfortunately it wa in vain .
the forthcoming turn of the century will be a decisive event for Europe .
Mr Gauzès referred to the Growth and Stability Pact .
we advocate equal treatment for all country , and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment a other country .
the decision which we have to take today is not a trivial one .
we thus decided to launch infringement proceeding again Spain on this issue .
from these two perspective , the European Parliament &apos;s proposal is therefore a compromise , providing scope for further necessary change in the future .
cooperation in the field of criminal and civil law establishes the principle of mutual recognition a the crux of the strategy .
thank you for your answer , which it wa also very nice to have in Swedish .
otherwise , by funding the Lukashenko regime , we will be responsible for it .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , a the European Commission stated in it communication of 22 July , the situation in the dairy farming sector ha deteriorated dramatically during the last 12 month .
let u avoid excessive diversion , but let u not throw the baby out with the bathwater , or seek scapegoat for problem that are not caused by technological change or variation in demand , but by speculative movement that the world should not allow and that we , together with all political force , should fight against .
the four Northern Regional Councils the Baltic , Barents , Nordic and Arctic Councils are important actor in this dialogue .
the reason often stem from difference in term of opportunity , access to service and material resource , a well a from different life choice made by individual .
you must insist that Israel stop the killing .
my report therefore call on the Council of Ministers to establish common minimal law and penalty to counter terrorist act , to abolish formal extradition procedure for those suspected or convicted of terrorist crime and to establish a European search and arrest warrant in the fight against terrorist group .
but despite that , you remained firm in your democratic fight for the right of your people , rejecting the offer of a pardon you were made for health reason .
this is emphasised very strongly in the report .
in this regard , it is significant that the vice-president is to be Giuliano Amato , who is a member of the Italian and European left but , most importantly , an advocate of that oligarchic desire to have the institution run just by a few aristocrat , by a small , unelected elite .
how much longer will Parliament feel obliged to express it confidence in this way , while waiting for an eventual SEM 2000 ?
in conclusion , I believe that much can be learned from an exchange of view between Member States on energy policy , and I support Mr Chichester &apos; s call for the Commission to highlight example of best practice in integrating environmental objective in the energy policy .
I move that this amendment be adopted , so that we can dispense with a second reading of this proposal for a regulation , otherwise the regulation , which is already overdue , could not enter into force in good time .
responsible policy designed to combat climate change are not based on a deindustrialisation of Europe but on the viability of Europe a an industrial location , and on industry in Europe which produce without harming the environment and which export environmental protection .
nevertheless , I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of word in a censorious way , because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement .
what is certain is that no wholly military solution is possible in Afghanistan .
for the former , the Committee set aside EUR 181 million , with EUR 600 million being set aside for the latter .
now , we must bring about an export ban that enters into force before this . otherwise , the chlor-alkali industry , which ha the largest stock of mercury in Europe , will export huge quantity of it .
Mr Esteve ha presented a well-balanced document which is certainly positive whilst also taking account of all the suggestion made by the various groups
President Daul explained this by mean of a letter to Commissioner Fisher-Boel .

for all these reason , I voted in favour of the text negotiated with the Council in order to reach agreement at second reading .
every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved one .
I support the proposal that set-aside be fixed at 5 % for the 1998 harvest but without reducing payment for land taken out of production .

for five year Ireland ha enjoyed an average growth of 5 % , with unemployment down from over 16 % to scarcely 4 % and a budget surplus of over 4.5 % .
this constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof .
I must point out that these country have not met all the deficit criterion .
I think however that this Expert Group on Financial Education should have clear responsibility and power .
the other institution , too , are working hard to ensure that the effect of enlargement are ironed out , and we cannot wait for these adjustment until 2004 .
trade can be an important part of a long-term economic solution for Pakistan .
does the Minister agree that no matter how many year before Tibet regains it freedom , no European state should recognise the illegal action by the Chinese Government in Tibet and that the transfer of ten of thousand of non-Tibetan people into Amdo is illegal under international law ?
Mr President , item 11 of yesterday &apos;s Minutes refers to a speech I made under Rule 121 ( a ) of the Rules of Procedure .
fourthly and lastly the efficiency of public funding for risk capital activity must be improved and it is important that public funding should not crowd out private sector investment .
now , we know the obsession of the Commission chaired by Mr Barroso with having these impact assessment carried out regularly a part of better regulation , which it us a a roadmap .
I therefore call on you to adopt this report , and I also ask Commissioner Frattini to do so on behalf of the citizen of Europe .
this is also one of those rare liberalisation directive which fails to specify this aspect in a detailed manner .
in other word , if we fail in a future debate to give region and nation a place in Europe , we in fact further separatism .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , our financial forecast for the year 2000 to 2006 , upon which our cohesion policy depends , will be decided in March next year , according to the Cardiff Summit , after the effect of the German election have been put into perspective .
in my opinion , the Lampedusa issueshould not have been marked down for debate because it is a matter of bilateral agreement between Italy and Libya and the enforcement of Italian law that do not contravene the EU Treaties .
would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency , under it control , which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agency in our Member States in the field of communicable disease ?
if we can reach agreement on this point , then I think we will have solved the problem .
so that the Canadian and European market will become more competitive and more secure , and so that product-approval procedure will become shorter and simpler , I am voting in favour of the proposal in question .
I would stress that not all food can or will be irradiated .
it ha shown a willingness to look at other area also .
the Commission ha already determined other substance ; a Mrs Doyle said , they were confined to three and , a far a I know , this ha not changed since .
the increased power of a transnational financial capitalism in which capital movement and speculation are more important than real trade in good is causing serious imbalance , chaos and crisis , while inequality between and within country are increasing .

this statute doe not yet confer European legal personality , but the financing see u taking the first step , with the second step , in the form of an actual European statute , perhaps yet to come .
by that , are you saying that you would be prepared to make greater use of some of the dairy management tool that are at your disposal , such a export refund , aid to private storage and intervention ?
yesterday there wa a disgraceful Communist demonstration in the courtyard of the Tower .
we have to do more in the fight against terrorism , but without suppressing the right of those under investigation and those who have been charged .
does the Commission regard Prime Minister Tariceanu ’ s concession to give Romanian farmer financial help with the purchase of tractor from the factory in Brasov a an infringement of the EU ’ s competition directive ?
what is the Commission &apos;s current view of the scientific and political debate in Spain over the estimate of the minimum ecological flow of the Ebro river to it delta after the Ebro transfer ?

sadly , I consider that the only way to keep drug away from sportsman is to decommercialise sport .
it ha just been revealed that the Minister for Agriculture from his party in the United Kingdom ha not even been in dialogue with his opposite number in France , which is ridiculous when you consider the way temper are getting raised in the process of this trade war .
accession to this area would be open to surrounding country that fulfil the basic Copenhagen criterion of being democratic , having market economy and respecting human right .
the Doha Development Round wa not worthy of it name .
I would , therefore , invite Parliament to continue to support the transfer of the administrative aspect of custom cooperation which are currently under Title 6 of the Treaty from the third pillar to the Community &apos;s sphere .
as you will realise , that is a binding statement , committing the United States to a certain kind of conduct .
we can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging country , China in particular , which are winning contract with rock-bottom price in the country of the Union , without regard for social right and legislation on State aid , whereas the market of these country remain inaccessible to European company .
I doubt whether I would be within my right to ask the national parliament of our partner country to respond to the country strategy paper .
today &apos;s debate in this Assembly ha shown that Parliament and the Commission are to a large extent agreed on how the battle should be fought .
all three institution will need to show goodwill and make sacrifice and compromise if this arrangement is to work , but it is a prize well worth fighting for because the single market in security will yield many benefit for the people we are elected to represent .
the United States , in a different context , ha being referring to the currency situation in China , namely the Chinese peg , which United States commentator are saying is compounding the situation regarding export from China .
Mr President , Mr Kallas , Mr López Garrido , in this case , we have seen that nature really is more powerful than any of the technology available to u .
it is the result of a construction in which the Member States and the Commission bear the main responsibility : the Maastricht criterion in the Stability and Growth Pact - which ha of course already been watered down under Commissioner Almunia &apos;s leadership - the deficit procedure , the clear statistical data and the independence of the European Central Bank .
in order to counter the proliferation of refusal of approval , it would be of great assistance if the Court of Auditors were to publish them in future in it annual report .
it is asymmetric , limited to a few rare sector , such a transport , communication and finance and in fact only concern the OECD country plus a dozen more or le developing country , whereas the majority of third world country remain under-developed .

when we point out area in which Kosovo &apos;s leader need to improve , for example with regard to the protection of minority , this is because we are serious when we say that we will stand by Kosovo in it effort to create a democratic society . a democratic society with respect for minority , coexisting peacefully with it neighbouring country .
therefore we can agree to the amendment proposed by Parliament that certain firework do not fall under the directive if they are produced by manufacturer for their own use and if their use by the manufacturer himself ha been approved by the respective Member State .

the reference to State aid for purpose of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States , but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice .

it seems to me that , in a healthy democracy , there can be the opportunity to vote . that is what I believe , and I am not offending Parliament when I tell it to reach a verdict , while I perhaps regret the fact that this procedure doe not allow it to reach a verdict on a text that ha been improved – I have no hesitation in saying this – by the committee .

people who are really persecuted are refused the status of refugee , on the ground that their persecutor are not Government agent , and the Council ratified this restrictive interpretation in a resolution of March 1996 .
we do not envisage opposition to reforming the main policy on expenditure . rather , it is a case of stressing the importance of keeping to the agreed timetable , and therefore following a different course from that set for the enlargement negotiation .
what is vital now is that million of refugee should be helped to return to living condition worthy of human being , to provide themselves with the basic necessity of life , which mean not just food and drinking water , demining and the return of land to it owner , but most of all ensuring their physical security .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you will find it more difficult to achieve the necessary compromise at European level if the mood within Germany is different .

the additionality rule can be met in various way and yet the government ha done nothing .
let u give it another name , because it resonates with other implication .
this is also true of the contribution to environmental organisation .
nor should we forget the Mediterranean aspect of the Union , the investment in the fruit and vegetable sector which will have to compete with the substantial need for economic aid of large country dependent on agriculture .

it ha not , however , been demonstrated , and still le proved , that the most suitable and effective method of coping with these breach of the law is to set up a further European agency or common EU coastguard .
how should the challenge of the future be tackled ?
the money that is available should be spent on the need of our 375 million people and on the protection of our environment , not on the European Parliament a an institution .
