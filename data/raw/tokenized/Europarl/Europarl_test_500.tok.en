I see far faster movement in the economic and internal market sphere than in the social sphere and there are real dangers of a growing imbalance in that respect .
We know , however , that there are still many obstacles which need to be overcome in order to reach agreements , particularly in matters relating to its independence and jurisdiction .
I would dwell at length on what are the guiding principles of this proposal , but I shall limit myself to considering growth and employment .
Although this process of establishing the internal market in services is very important for Europe ’ s economic development , the rules ensuring European social cohesion must be complied with .
Sidelining this section of the debate once again will not help us , in my opinion , to break the deadlock .
Mr Commissioner , you have primarily concentrated on the logistical and technical aspects , and you have only just begun to touch on the monetary risks that could ensue from what you call the gigantic holdings by foreigners of German marks but also presumably of other euro zone currencies .
This means that the European Parliament must develop effective instruments so that it can exert control over the application of the programme , as well as proper budgetary management .
The necessary information on each Member State must be made available so as to increase the effectiveness of control and monitoring systems , and to ensure that we have a true picture of the situation .
One thing is certain , one thing which I have learned in the course of my contacts with countries which , only recently , were suffering under communist dictatorships : those countries cannot emerge unaided .
Mr President , I am sorry that almost no Members of the elected European Commission are present .
Member of the Commission . - Everyone in this Chamber will know that the Commission has been a very strong and present partner in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland for years .
This company has deliberately not paid its employees the money owing to them , either in full – I have statements that this has occurred – or in part .
That is the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you , Commissioner – on various minimum sizes , which we would have liked to fix more decisively : sardines and cod caught in the northern seas do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the Mediterranean .
I would like to mention that the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights obviously will not resolve the problem of the European Court of Human Rights being completely overloaded with work .
The rapporteur has been influenced by bad counsel of the sort we can easily imagine - by partisan and party interests - and has wasted and bungled the opportunity she had to present a serious discussion on human rights , losing herself in empty tirades and gratuitous accusations worthy of a low-profile debate . The judges and police officers of some of the Member States are described as torturers , accused of beating up innocent people .
Amendments Nos 2 , 4 and 14 should in fact be set aside in favour of Amendment No 21 , which is intended to promote the safe handling of these materials so as to avoid serious environmental consequences .
We are all right behind you .
It is also interesting to note that CFSP will not really mean &apos; common foreign and security policy &apos; as long as it is totally off-limits to discuss , within the framework of our foreign policy cooperation , what two of the Member States of this Union are doing in the UN Security Council .
I would , however , urge them to read the text carefully .
We must fight torture , terrorism and every crime against humanity .
Does Europe really not have the authority to say to Israel ‘ It is time to end the Israeli military occupation ’ ?
That is why Labour Euro MPs voted against calls for a 5 % budget increase .
Since that occasion in April 2003 there has been a considerable amount of effort , discussion and negotiation on the part of Parliament and the Council in order to arrive at the compromise before you today .
To bridge this gap , however , the European People &apos;s Party does not believe the solution lies in adopting a comprehensive directive that would be difficult to implement and inefficient .
Commissioner , please ensure that , if there is an avian flu jab , it will be mercury-free .
There are nine other applicant countries - if I leave aside Cyprus and Malta where it is presumably easier to control the borders - so we have ten applicant countries , all with problems like this , without enough money to meet the cost .
In addition , I would like to underline another important factor mentioned in the relevant reports which is that the conclusion of these agreements will imply a considerable financial burden for Macedonia and other Western Balkan countries .
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection .
The first months have given us only a vague picture of the intentions of the authorities in Minsk .
Finally , we should be able to quickly draw the consequences of a piece of legislation , the implementation of which creates more problems than it solves .
Moreover , even if it is important for many authorities to collect revenue for the information it produces when it is being used for commercial purposes , it is important that our citizens can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own lives and health without having to pay for it .
It was very much in the spirit of the entente cordiale .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should now like to focus on the specific lessons that I have drawn from this affair , and set out some proposals which , I hope , will correspond to your recommendations for the future .
In short , we shall vote in favour of the Brinkhorst report , as I said , despite our doubts as to how effective a weapon this will be against the Council .
This would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another sees its numbers peak .
I cannot , I fear , offer similar congratulations to the Agriculture Council on its conclusions of 25 and 26 June , in relation to the reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , because I believe that these conclusions pave the way for severe problems for family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers . Women in rural areas play a prominent role in such farms , especially in less-favoured regions and in countries such as my own .
Fitzsimons recommendation ( A4-0052 / 99 )
It is about time we put more ethanol in petrol , and with the new decisions we will at least have half the rate that Brazil has .
On behalf of my group I should like to say that my group congratulates Mr Verde i Aldea for his report .
Unfortunately , recent statements from some people do not encourage optimism .
The problem of mobility poses a multitude of risks , however .
Is it an attempt to move closer towards the Syrian and Libyan dictatorships , which are constantly violating human rights ?
The second area which I believe should be a particular priority for us is the development of intercultural relations .
Indeed , over the last year and a half in particular , bloody terrorist brutality has shaken the entire world .
The draft budget envisages a drastic reduction in the appropriations allocated to this line .
Obviously , that everything possible should be done to obtain a cease-fire within the framework of a regional conference for peace , security and stability in the region , which could be held under the aegises of the UN and the OAU .
The European Structural Funds grant the local and regional authorities and the social players extensive rights of participation .
With regard to Honduras , I would remind you that the Honduras army is in multinational hands , and that when the Honduras tax authorities wish to levy taxes on a crate of bananas , they are forbidden to do so .
We welcome President Khatami &apos;s intervention , the action of lecturers and students in protesting and Dr Aghajari &apos;s own appeal for calm .
Mr President , I greatly welcome the ARGO action programme .
We should be giving the countries that are about to join us a sheaf of unambiguous and harmonised regulations that they know they can stick to and be guided by .
I will concentrate on two areas .
This has attracted the support of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and of Parliament .
Just ask journalists in Brussels , for example .
The people there are now trying , especially in Tunisia and Egypt , to build new countries - democratic countries where there is respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law .
Mr President , the symbol of the Red Cross / Red Crescent movement brings hope to battlefields worldwide .
Mr President , it seems to me that we need to distinguish two aspirations which are contained in the Galeote report and which to some extent lead in different directions .
But we must go further and be more ambitious .
An important step forwards .
That is why these objectives are more important than ever .
Let me refer , by way of example , to Mr Khanbhai &apos; s report , which revealed some problems in the ECSC accounts , including , among other things , the solvency ratio and the transfer of property , although the Commission and the High Authority are currently reducing these problems with a view to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002 .
I am quite simply stating the political reality , which is not very positive , and I strongly urge the Council to draw lessons from this negative situation and ensure that , the next time the Treaties are reviewed , the structures are changed , as the current shortcomings of the institutions are preventing us from doing good .
I know that I have by no means covered all our foreign policy areas , but I should like to conclude with a few thoughts on the changing nature of European integration .
I would draw Parliament &apos; s attention to the fact that this is indeed a natural disaster for these floods and this rain were twenty times greater than normal .
Indeed , as he says , we have reached a very satisfactory outcome .
By way of conclusion , I should like to say that the situation seems to be improving , although a very great deal remains to be done .
If we are to believe the rapporteur , the risks from uncontrolled use of herbal medicines are considerable .
In fact , the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt , which reached 7.1 % of GDP in 2001 - and is estimated as 4 % of GDP in 2002 - meant that the evolution of the debt ratio does not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administrations , the achievement of increasingly high primary surpluses or the growth in GDP .
To sum up , for all the reasons I have given , I do not think it is acceptable to allow the citizens to shoulder all the responsibility .
We now need to build on that hope together .
As the House will know and as has been remarked again this morning , the parliamentary and presidential elections early this year resulted in the change of government in Croatia and brought a new political climate .
A few other MEPs have already mentioned this topic , and we have also discussed it with the Commissioner within the framework of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy .
I am convinced that this was the main reason for the declaration by the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine , Mrs Kalay-Kleitman , who stated in an interview with the Serkalo Nedeli that Israel cannot recognise the Holodomor as an act of ethnic genocide .
It is has also played a crucial role in easing sectarian tensions and bridging the divisions between the two traditions on the island .
We consider that the limits on TAC changes should be plus or minus 15 % to be in accordance with scientific advice .
That is the signal .
The Committee on Legal Affairs looks at this issue through legal spectacles , as you would expect .
Mr President , I was just about to say that the issue of information is also fundamental .
Nor do I believe that it makes sense to wire the whole Parliament and install a wireless LAN in all the buildings ; these are not our core tasks in this connection .
A legal basis must therefore be decided at the intergovernmental conference in order to enable the Council to vote by qualified majority , no longer unanimously , within the social sphere .
They are doing a good job and need to know that they can sign contracts for buildings and pay salaries for next year .
Mr President , we see more and more every day how a common European immigration policy has become essential .
At this point , I welcome Mr Patten &apos; s commitment to transparency in the use of European aid .
The other hurdle that you must surmount is the paucity of public preparedness .
She is a very fine example of how a rapporteur should behave in conducting Parliament &apos;s business and committee business .
If we want to make a go of multilateralism , then we ourselves need to set an example , be consistent and show how well it can work in the future , because the IMF has an absolutely crucial role to play in the field of global governance , a role that transcends the issue of European debt and of the sovereign debt situations of the European countries that are struggling .
Everyone knows how crucial and burning this issue is , with the partisans of prohibition and the tenants of an &apos; alternative policy &apos; often poles apart .
Mr President , let me thank Commissioner Papoutsis , because I think he has taken some important initiatives which go beyond mere words and extend to the promotion of practical measures , no matter how difficult they may be and how many obstacles have to be overcome .
Firstly , there is broad consensus about the European Union &apos;s ability , within the NATO framework , to defend itself against any conceivable aggressor , whether this be done together with our allies , or , if need be , independently .
We have not made sufficient reference to former debates we have had in relation to the severe problems that implementation of this legislation will entail for certain regions such as small islands and isolated mountain regions .
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework .
Interinstitutional cooperation should therefore become more vigorous in the future and the role of the European Parliament in particular should be made more prominent .
Nevertheless , I wish to stress once again that economic hardship cannot serve as a pretext for undemocratic behaviour .
As some of you may already know , there is a leaked document on the future of the common agricultural policy towards 2020 , which also addresses the territorial challenges of the future .
It is therefore extremely important that the EU act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation , or WHO .
The so-called war veterans - they must have been very young when the war of independence was on - have been paid to be on these farms .
Mr President , it would thus mean that if you know that all the proteins originate from abroad , say from South America , that you will soon also need to label absolutely everything with GMO identification within the framework of this novel food directive .
The Commission will further investigate specific requirements for LPG combustion heaters to be added in Annex VIII .
It should respect the law and the rules , and immediately declare that further ratification of the now dead Lisbon Treaty is a completely useless exercise .
I stress this point because , in point of fact , among the priorities that have been indicated I can see three that meet this requirement of sustainable development for the men and women living in those countries .
But she is present , there she is .
As long as there is due consideration for the environment , the EU &apos;s objective should be to abolish all subsidies and to place farmers and food producers on an equal footing with other manufacturers and businesses in the Union .
. Mr President , this has been a very useful , rather balanced and proportionate debate , but I well understand the huge anxieties and sensitivities that are excited by this issue of textiles .
The decision to favour growing organic fodder legumes alone has not reassured the operators in this sector .
There may have been times when our instruments were slightly out of tune , but we have worked extremely well together .
The rules should be as easy as possible for these institutions to use .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically .
But we do have serious reservations on two points .
In addition , we can accept two amendments if we alter the wording slightly .
One transnational civil protection mechanism may help in dealing with natural disasters .
In the light of the Commission &apos;s options as presented , we , like the rapporteur , take the view that the list should not be further extended at this stage .
Question No 37 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis ( H-0324 / 02 ) :
The people who pay the bills are the customers of these companies , who pay them in higher prices and , above all , the people of Europe , who are priced out of jobs .
Mr President , Minister , I would like to ask if any decisions of principle have been taken regarding whether there should be a mandate from the UN or any other international organisation in discharging such tasks as these , as , under international law , a mandate from an international organisation is needed before any country &apos; s territory can legally be attacked in this way .
We must therefore take action wherever there is a threat to the world &apos;s cultural heritage .
It is a remarkable dossier we are discussing here , a highly technical one .
Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems ( debate )
In conclusion , we must achieve an effective control , application and notification system , as stated in recital A , but this system will inevitably require of the Member States a spirit of mutual trust and accountability and an equal commitment to notifying infringements securely and effectively .
As a result , the money of the funds will not be spent , and we will miss a major opportunity for development in eastern Europe .
I should like , if I may , to divide what I have to say into two parts : the first providing a specific Commission response to the four reports on the agenda , that is the Péry report , the two Arias Cañete reports and the Kofoed report ; and a second in which I shall attempt to reply to more general issues raised here by many colleagues and many honourable Members .
Today , if we want to put a stop to these horrors , it is necessary , before all else , to name the guilty party : Islam , which , like Communism , seeks to use terrorism as a means of imposing a totalitarian system .
After thirty years of being ignored , of silence and of broken promises , the time has come for the world in general , and Europe in particular , to stop turning its back on the problem and to face it head on .
Seven years after the Iranian regime tried to convince the Iranians and the international community that it was open to change and to democratisation , it is now clear - to all the observers , and to the Iranian people first and foremost - that nothing has changed for the better and no improvement in the human rights situation or the democratic rights has taken place .
In our first action programme , eEurope 2002 , we had a special approach to e-transport , but it was not , unfortunately , able to create sufficient interest among the Member States .
I thought that it was a general rule in this House that if the Commission wishes to speak out on something , it actually does so .
The objective of adequate , safe and high quality food is a human requirement and demand of the workers which cannot be safeguarded within the framework of the capitalist method of production and trade in agricultural products .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Angola is still suffering from war , destruction and the senseless , shocking loss of human lives .
However , these shortcomings should not cloud the fact that an impressive job has been done on the ground by the Agency &apos;s staff .
I believe that this really is a very significant issue and it is very important because it affects all the Members of a Parliament whose powers , we must admit , have increased .
However , the Commission does not consider that research involving embryos should be excluded as such from the Union &apos;s research programmes , and just now I referred to the opportunities that such research can provide in very important sectors .
I considered the report , which agrees with the conclusion of a Voluntary Partnership Agreement between Cameroon and the European Union , to be worthy of support during the vote .
We worked very hard with the Spanish Presidency in recent months .
In 2006 alone , Europe was richer by EUR 240 billion , or the equivalent of EUR 518 for every European citizen because of the single market .
We should seize that opportunity within a wider Northern Dimension policy .
There is no room for fudge or lack of clarity .
The Spanish are the main beneficiaries , with the Canaries where 91 % of the fleet is dependent on this agreement , and with Andalusia where 75 % of the fleet is involved , and there would be a cost to pay if there were to be no agreement .
( MT ) Mr President , it is a disgrace that , once again , so many people had to lose their lives before the European Union &apos;s lack of concrete action on immigration was exposed .
On hearing this you say : &apos; yes , of course that is quite right &apos; , but this appeal would in fact suggest that the European Union and the European Member States have been far too quick to seize their weapons in the past , in different contexts .
The spirit of Schengen is a spirit of trust and solidarity .
The amount proposed corresponds to 20 % of the appropriations for heading five and therefore respects the ceiling which the European Parliament itself set for 2001 .
Now some points for the future .
I believe that the political will shown yesterday by the representatives of the various political groupings in the discussions of the Committee on Budgets will bear fruit .
Mrs Green spoke in favour of the resolution which was put to this Chamber .
Moreover , the Convention establishes no links with other Community databases - some of which have already been mentioned , such as SCENT or IRENE - the database for the fight against fraud , or the IDA proposal to facilitate the smooth functioning of the single market .
The Rules of Procedure stipulate that in these cases , the Presidency has the last word as regards the applicable interpretation .
The Council &apos; s hesitation concerning Article 3 makes it abundantly clear how crucial it is for Parliament to be given the right of codecision making on competition policy .
If we no longer want Turkish secularism to be defended by the army or by judicial coups , let women take care of this .
It has already been decided that we will conduct negotiations in parallel with all three countries , but they will not necessarily be completed at the same time .
Although there are some worthwhile objectives - for example , the twinning of cities , civic projects , various surveys and studies , art events and conferences - there are others that are indicative of unacceptable political influence , such as excluding fascist crimes from support under new Action 4 - Active European Memory .
This is why we are there and why we need to remain there .
First of all , the committee proposes taking into account the health of workers and consumer protection , by introducing the precautionary principle and the principle that the best available technology should be used so as to keep radiation as low as possible .
A great deal will depend on how the Member States themselves implement the provisions of this regulation , however .
1 .
We have 70 amendments to a report on chickens , seeking to improve conditions for laying hens , in particular by imposing requirements for more space and stimulus .
But although Europe aspires to running a frontier-free market , the EU cannot regulate these transfrontier vital services .
Tobacco consumption must regularly decrease and production must continue to be limited to a constant tonnage of 351 000 gross tonnes of European tobacco , between the proposed new COM and the present COM .
I say yes , and I believe that other honourable Members will share that view .
The EU must help our citizens who are in trouble as a result of the worldwide crisis .
It is another gradual step forwards , definitely not backwards .
Thus , we are certainly among those who offer the Czech Presidency particular support and do not intend to attach too much importance to teething problems - the rather one-sided initial position on the Gaza conflict and the Czech President &apos;s view that social and environmental standards are too high have already been mentioned .
Besides , Parliament &apos; s passion for regulation , as borne out by so many amendments , will result in a regulation that is difficult to implement .
Noise pollution is very disturbing and can form a threat to health .
Thank you .
I dare to hope that this bizarre collusion is not the result of any shameful bargaining .
The statement of assurance is supposed to cover &apos; down to the level of taxpayers &apos; .
I am grateful for the constructive and very positive involvement of nearly all of you .
You took the unprecedented step – the fifth enlargement but the first time ever – to invite observer MPs from every State , and that is greatly to your credit .
Trans-European networks are urgently required .
Our task now is to continue working for the civil and customs protection of our geographical indications , which are damaged by competition which is at the very least unfair , due to the constant use of names and acronyms that reference the best-known European brands .
It is also high time , I believe , that the Commission abandoned its blind belief in neo-liberalism and , instead of accepting a downward spiral of competitive deflation and fiscal dumping , changed course to return to and build on the ideas of Brüning , to create a situation and a policy that would take us beyond Keynes .
Are you proposing to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect ?
We hope that the European Parliament will become ever more involved in protecting these rights and , above all , we are pleased to support the idea of continuous monitoring of all the legislative activities that will lead to such protection , which , as the Commissioner was saying , could culminate in a final report .
The German Federal Government , our political parties , social partners , employers &apos; and workers &apos; associations , will not tolerate the planned restrictions on our posting of workers legislation , and other European countries have similar misgivings .
Owing to the expansion of NATO right up to Russia &apos;s borders , the US is politically , even more than militarily , responsible for having encouraged Georgia to mount its surprise attack during the night of 7 to 8 August .
It is essential for the European Union to take a closer interest in these five countries : Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan .
You are embarking on your Presidency with more modesty , and I think you are right to do so .
The journeys take a very long time , the lorries used are full to bursting point , and the animals are short of water , food , and ventilation .
I wonder about the future of this report from the point of view of its integration into European policies .
In terms of research , the Commission welcomes Parliament &apos;s support for the development of a comprehensive marine research strategy which will be a cornerstone of maritime policy , and should be ready for adoption by mid-2008 .
I personally opposed this .
All this marks the transition to economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999 .
Almost 90 % of the complaints submitted by my fellow countrymen from the Czech Republic did not fall within the remit of the European Ombudsman .
It is pointless for us to make corrections if they are not recorded .
This contains two points of criticism put forward by my group , which , to our satisfaction , have ended up in Mrs Lalumière &apos; s report .
If we are asked to explain things - e.g. why something was done or was left undone - we are always available to you , to the Ombudsman and to other people as well .
Ladies and gentlemen , I urge you to vote against the megaliners in paragraph 21 .
We must all keep our fingers firmly crossed .
I am in favour of us including this service within the Commission , as that is where it belongs .
Everyone says that they are in favour of enlargement , but when it comes to paying the price of solidarity , political selfishness rears its head .
It also calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop a legal framework that recognise the social economy as a third sector as well as to set up clear rules for establishing which entities can legally operate as social economy enterprises .
by Mr Fjellner , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2007 ( C6-0437 / 2008 - ,
It is certainly not true that we are trying to ignore the matter .
That time – now for reflection , as identified by the European Council – will continue for a number of months .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks for the presentation of the Court of Auditors report .
They did not want to give Eurostat and the European Commission more powers to examine in depth the Greek national accounts .
This matter has to be discussed further , however ; unilateral steps must be avoided at all costs .
It is interesting that the British Minister of Agriculture , Mrs Beckett , has said that she will decide when farmers can go into the field , or when it is too wet or has been raining .
Finally , a word about the riots . I fully and firmly support what Mr Barón Crespo said .
These are not trivialities , they are very serious events and Europe needs to be concerned with them , especially when an important partner is involved .
. – Mr President , first of all , of course , I must congratulate my group colleague Mr Seppänen on his outstanding report ; he is right to stress the primary responsibility that is incumbent on the Member States where the storage or processing of nuclear waste is concerned , and they certainly have one when it comes to refusing to accept waste from outside their own borders .
As the draftsman of the REX Committee , I have taken a look at the draft regulation and , like Mr Virgin , I could only shake my head at some of the points proposed there .
Lukashenko has clearly stated that he will not bow to pressure from the West , and in negotiations with Medvedev on reducing gas prices , he declared that Belarus will not be indebted to Russia .
What is it then that they are relying on us to do ?
. – The archipelagos of the Azores , Madeira and the Canary Islands , and the French overseas departments , are referred to as the EU ’ s outermost regions and are characterised by their remoteness , insularity , small size , difficult topography and climate and economic dependence on a few products .
The debate on the future of Europe involved all the main players ; it took place in the full light of day ; and it produced a coherent text on which the Intergovernmental Conference has been able to work effectively .
Because people in European countries are seemingly in danger of failing to understand these matters , the European Parliament is suggesting to the Member States that they adopt ‘ the measures necessary to promote understanding of immigration and integration as positive factors for the economy and for economic growth , and as elements of cultural enrichment ’ ( paragraph 20 ) .
The badger-spread disease was first discovered on the day he was due to leave on a two-week holiday last June , and he has since lost 64 of his 82-strong herd .
When and where the rights of the minority are observed , the society will for the most part be just and tolerant .
in writing . - ( NL ) I emphatically voted against this report .
The market is quite capable of regulating itself .
How are they and their children looked after ?
They are coffee , butter , rice , pasta and drinking milk .
I agree very strongly with the speakers who said that it was not the European Union itself that was in crisis but that a part , a good part , of the Member States had become entangled in a debt crisis , a debt spiral .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to add my thanks to the Commission , which has remained as faithful as it possibly could to Parliament ’ s position .
The legitimate representatives of the Saharan people now accept the new draft solution advocated by Kofi Annan ’ s special envoy .
This directive alters the very definition of chocolate which should , in our opinion , be made from cocoa butter and beans .
The guides for applicants for these measures , involving complex paperwork , were made public one day before the launch of the session , although they had been written in August .
Are we going to concern ourselves with strengthening legal safeguards as much as possible while terrorists move freely from one continent to another and mercilessly murder thousands of people , who – incidentally – have not been given any right to defend themselves ?
In the light of the suspension of all grants from a number of budget lines involving the Commission &apos;s DG VIII ( possibly including the one relating to the &apos; Gender action on the WTO &apos; project ) , which puts all projects on hold until the spring of 1999 at the very earliest , what has the Commission decided to do about projects that are directed towards development education and advocacy work concerning the preparations for the WTO &apos;s Third Ministerial Conference due to take place in the US in the autumn of 1999 ?
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission &apos; s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament .
It is based on four key objectives : promoting early diagnosis , improving epidemiological knowledge of the disease , supporting solidarity between Member States , and respecting the rights of people living with the various forms of dementia .
Consequently , through these actions Finnish shipyards have achieved world-wide competitiveness , which the Commission is now trying to take away from us .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
This proposal aims at fighting more effectively the exploitation of migrant workers through dissuasive administrative sanctions and through penal sanctions in the most serious cases , including trafficking , and where particularly exploitative working conditions are found .
Above all , does it intend to heed the wishes of citizens of entire regions of Europe , where the majority of the population wishes to protect itself against GMOs , or does the Commission intend instead to be seduced by the misleading publicity alleging technological progress ?
The money would have been taken out of football if there had been a heavier fine .
2 ) In a situation in which , in view of the introduction of the euro , a binding and substantial EU economic policy is indispensable for all those who do not want to surrender the main aspects of economic policy to the bankers of the ECB - and consequently to the dictate of the financial markets - , we are now for the first time actually considering providing the Union with binding directives on economic policy .
. Mr President , we know setting up an internal energy market between the EU and the countries of south-east Europe has advantages for both sides : for the Balkan states it helps establish the reliable energy supply necessary for economic growth , and for us on the EU side it facilitates access to gas resources in the Middle East and around the Caspian Sea , enhancing diversity and security of supply – especially important since the ripples in the pool that were alluded to by Mr Chichester .
All this makes for continued tension when it comes to the demand for openness on the part of the ECB .
We have not of course read it directly , but a copy of the letter to Mr Asp - which I assume has been correctly reproduced - has now been published in the Swedish media which , after referring to the television programme , state that Mr Kinnock wrote in the following terms to Mr Asp : &quot; As you perhaps know , this statement has , fairly or unfairly , been interpreted as criticism of the Commission as an institution .
Companies receive credits , they invest , they want to make money , but when there are mobilisations by local groups that have been excluded or due to price rises resulting from privatisation , the European companies then decide to leave and furthermore demand compensation for it , which aggravates the crisis even further .
This should further the cross-national mobility of students , the recognition of diplomas and qualifications and the free movement of qualified students in Europe .
Nonetheless , we trust that it will provide ample opportunity for thought and will inspire us to adopt measures , now that the European Parliament is preparing to enlarge and to welcome representatives from the new Member States .
It was the largest Portuguese exporter , and before being known for the problems that led to its insolvency , it was preparing to invest in new technologies and had secured public funding to support the production of solar cells .
When the Commission between 1989 and 1991 discussed the tax arrangements for the establishment of the internal market with this Parliament , the then Commissioner responsible for fiscal matters declared herself ready to carry out a study on the social and economic consequences for all professions whose future was to be concerned by the entry into force of the internal market arrangements on 1 January 1993 and to look for appropriate solutions where necessary .
I would simply like to propose going to Brazil , for example , to see what becomes of children there who are from broken or single-parent families .
In any case , the application of unilateral sanctions against European products on the part of the United States would be unacceptable and would seriously damage the trust and cooperation that characterise our relationship .
The scientific reports say that all of them pose a risk to health and that one of them both causes cancer and aggravates it , and you dare to say in all seriousness , Sir Leon , that now there should be greater transparency .
At the same time , any changes or replacements will be easier for the major companies , whereas small- to medium-sized enterprises will be unable to handle the cost and thus shrink in size .
Progress is slow ; the work consumes 6 % of Ukraine &apos;s gross national income .
I would now like to make a statement .
We should also look at environmental and social policy and , when we talk of progress for these countries , it is important that we do not simply measure , as the Commission often does , growth in foreign investment and the economy , but that we also look at how far the countries are able to incorporate aspects of the working environment and social policy into their competition policy .
That would perhaps make it easier to settle the ongoing debate in France and other European countries on reality television .
I also take the liberty of adding a few comments of my own .
The Commission proposals as they stand now , if implemented in their entirety , would have the following detrimental effects on Irish agriculture .
We are glad the Council has accepted a proposal to append to the decision an additional statement from the Commission on encouraging the participation of small and medium-sized NGOs , and the possibility of fully funding their actions by national agencies .
In this recommendation for second reading , the European Parliament proposed in Amendments Nos 4 , 5 , and 7 that as far as the registration of passengers is concerned , companies operating a railway tunnel must meet the same requirements as those operating a passenger ship .
However , the same concern about consistency prevents us from accepting Amendments Nos 3 , 7 and 14 .
It is essential from the point of view of the Union &apos; s credibility that words and deeds go hand in hand .
Nevertheless , this year it expresses ‘ grave concern at the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ’ .
The rapporteur , my colleague Wim van Velzen , has produced an excellent report , undoubtedly with the support of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
I support the conclusion that a different instrument is needed to close this gap for non-ODA ( Official Development Assistance ) activities .
The culture of cronyism and hiding behind collective decision-making has to come to an end .
In a moment my colleague Vladimir Špidla will outline to you the approach the Commission adopted today .
Today &apos;s world is evidently different .
It is pie in the sky to think that differences in Europe can be erased with socio-economic interventions .
The Commission also appreciates the important role the European Parliament plays in putting the fight against violence on the agenda of the European Union .
We know there is ongoing work .
Those who say , however , that the summit is not , in itself , the end of the road and that it will not , by itself , revolutionise relations with Africa are right .
As a result of the work of my colleagues in this Parliament , past and present , especially Mr Bowis , we can be content in having taken a step forward in ensuring clarification for patients , improved healthcare choice and greater cooperation between the different EU healthcare systems .
It is a multidimensional problem .
Perhaps these positions , when read in context , will help us to extricate ourselves from the present conflict between larger and smaller States , which is paralysing the Intergovernmental Conference .
You know that at the first stage , we are proposing a regime for the euro area Member States and , at the second stage , for all 27 Member States .
In the light of these circumstances , there is still a consensus that eradication of the present outbreak without the use of generalised vaccination is the best course of action .
Secondly , the codecision procedure has been considerably simplified , mainly by abolishing the third reading which Parliament so abhorred .
It is bad for them .
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .
- Report : Leinen
( FI ) Madam President , I want to mention three matters very briefly .
In conclusion , I call on all my colleagues to support this report and I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to you all to visit Cyprus in 2008 , to enjoy Cypriot hospitality and to spend your euros freely in the sun .
With new legislative proposals , we should not be pushed to provide opinions and reports at breakneck speed which allow us little time for thought and consultation with interest groups and citizens .
I would like to inform the House that , as rapporteur , I support the amendment tabled by the socialists but cannot accept the PPE and the GUE / NGL amendments . I will give my reasons for that .
Congratulations to all the rapporteurs on their work .
The debate is closed .
The Commission has provided no facts whatsoever to demonstrate why it is necessary ; instead we are referred to a theoretical danger .
I think we should do something about this .
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can answer you at least in part .
We will always be on the side of democracy and not of tyranny .
An agreement was reached last weekend thanks to concessions both from Member States and MEPs .
You can write anything you like on paper .
I hope that I am not right , but if we go on like this , perhaps we should join in a chorus of &quot; Nearer my God to Thee &quot; , standing in the middle and singing it .
For this reason , we have to support a UN-led solution that is as prompt and peaceful as possible .
Therefore , what sustainable development project is the Commission implementing for Niger ?
3 600 people dead , most of them civilians .
The case of Manuel Rosales only confirms what I am saying .
It is about time we discussed this shameful subject , addressed this inhumane phenomenon , and began to effectively counteract sexual assault in Haiti .
- ( FR ) At its meeting of 7 May 1999 , the European Parliament adopted the EU-Mexico Global Agreement even though none of its Members knew the terms of negotiation of its trade aspects .
The paralogisms of the past must stop .
Almost a quarter of Romanian territory will become arid in the next 20 years and many plant species will disappear .
Subsequently , the introduction of a common European system for comparing fingerprints should be considered .
I believe that this is a very rigorous , very interesting and very well executed piece of work on a genuinely difficult subject .
Actually , they have done something . They have massively financed their public postal service companies and now , rationalised , financed , with enormous economic power , they intend to enter the rest of the European Union &apos; s postal service markets .
Russia appears to be an essential partner in seeking this lasting solution to the crisis in Kosovo .
What is hard to take in this whole situation is the fact that this reflects the relationship between the EU and Russia .
Towards a common European foreign policy on energy ( debate )
My fellow Member from Greece , Mrs Rapti , mentioned that there were political undertones behind the desire to amalgamate agencies , and she said that we must not interfere with agencies in Greece .
No one in Europe has lost their identity but , and this is the important point , make them work together in their substantial common interests which are social and economic , as I often say &apos; spilling their sweat and not their blood &apos; , and by doing that we can breakdown the barriers and centuries and the new Europe will have evolved .
Lastly , I welcome the proposals that Structural Funds should be used to support R &#91; amp &#93; D actions at regional level and a ‘ European excellence label ’ .
Mr President , my group would also like to express its condolences to those involved in the Samina Express disaster .
Western companies continue to exploit their patent monopolies on techniques and crops , development cooperation focuses too little on agriculture and technological expertise is not passed on .
I hope that the Member States will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealings with it .
I cannot imagine that we would bring toys into circulation which claim 5 million victims annually .
Discussions on debt relief for the countries seriously affected by the disaster in the Indian Ocean are going on in Paris .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Looked at from that angle , it is good and necessary that the Commission wants to do some repairs and so attaches primary importance to the transport facilities having greater and better interoperability and intermodality and intends to see to it that the candidate countries are better interconnected , tied in and involved .
When we speak about a competitive market , again interconnection is an absolute necessity .
Meanwhile , it is becoming understood that a greater reliance has to be placed on a sustainable model of production and consumption , and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resources .
This House had actually pressed for that .
Is that the case ?
Milosevic did not in fact set in motion his devilish machinery to wipe out a whole people at the moment when NATO started bombing .
Nor can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 23 , 24 and 25 .
One of these amendments proposes the implementation and application of the policies of the financial instrument for fisheries .
So besides adopting specific resolutions - and there are clearly no objections to that , which is why we are debating it here - , perhaps we ought in future to examine another more effective way not just of expressing solidarity but of becoming more effective in substance .
The three reports outline several possible directions of work in this respect .
I would prefer this renunciation not to dispel the idea that we have a common need to serve the United Nations &apos; peace-keeping missions , and to begin , at least , to equip ourselves with the intellectual resources of common security thinking before we draw any conclusions from it about defence .
Certainly in Scotland that has been a bone of contention .
Still more needs to be done to ensure that high quality jobs are accessible to all to start with , but poverty reduction has to go well beyond questions of employment .
What did the person who thought up this name have in mind ?
The Council reminds the Member that the decision on the numbers of migrant workers to admit falls within the remit of each EU Member State , and I would add that it will continue to remain within the remit of each Member State even after the Constitution comes into force .
I think it timely that the report points out that there is no evidence that Europe is immune to such dramatic crises .
Are there any comments ?
Mixed reactions
There is no reason to block aid to its neighbours .
Our next objective is to resolve the Cyprus question , an objective which , unfortunately , we were unable to achieve prior to integration .
The new Directive seeks to go further by wider liberalization of the conditions under which lawyers can practise in all European Union countries .
EUR 50 million is the sum advanced by the Council of Ministers at the height of the Portuguese crisis , and this sum equals the value of national contributions to the restructuring of various Community programmes already mentioned by the Commissioner .
Thus , operators will not be using up their resources looking for loopholes ; instead , they will be seeking ways to effectively implement the objective .
We tabled an amendment to precisely that effect in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , but unfortunately it was in vain .
The forthcoming turn of the century will be a decisive event for Europe .
Mr Gauzès referred to the Growth and Stability Pact .
We advocate equal treatment for all countries , and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment as other countries .
The decision which we have to take today is not a trivial one .
We thus decided to launch infringement proceedings again Spain on this issue .
From these two perspectives , the European Parliament &apos;s proposal is therefore a compromise , providing scope for further necessary changes in the future .
Cooperation in the fields of criminal and civil law establishes the principle of mutual recognition as the crux of the strategy .
Thank you for your answer , which it was also very nice to have in Swedish .
Otherwise , by funding the Lukashenko regime , we will be responsible for it .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as the European Commission stated in its communication of 22 July , the situation in the dairy farming sector has deteriorated dramatically during the last 12 months .
Let us avoid excessive diversion , but let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater , or seek scapegoats for problems that are not caused by technological changes or variations in demand , but by speculative movements that the world should not allow and that we , together with all political forces , should fight against .
The four Northern Regional Councils the Baltic , Barents , Nordic and Arctic Councils are important actors in this dialogue .
The reasons often stem from differences in terms of opportunities , access to services and material resources , as well as from different life choices made by individuals .
You must insist that Israel stop the killing .
My report therefore calls on the Council of Ministers to establish common minimal laws and penalties to counter terrorist acts , to abolish formal extradition procedures for those suspected or convicted of terrorist crimes and to establish a European search and arrest warrant in the fight against terrorist groups .
But despite that , you remained firm in your democratic fight for the rights of your people , rejecting the offer of a pardon you were made for health reasons .
This is emphasised very strongly in the report .
In this regard , it is significant that the vice-president is to be Giuliano Amato , who is a member of the Italian and European left but , most importantly , an advocate of that oligarchic desire to have the institutions run just by a few aristocrats , by a small , unelected elite .
How much longer will Parliament feel obliged to express its confidence in this way , while waiting for an eventual SEM 2000 ?
In conclusion , I believe that much can be learned from an exchange of views between Member States on energy policy , and I support Mr Chichester &apos; s call for the Commission to highlight examples of best practice in integrating environmental objectives in the energy policy .
I move that this amendment be adopted , so that we can dispense with a second reading of this proposal for a regulation , otherwise the regulation , which is already overdue , could not enter into force in good time .
Responsible policies designed to combat climate change are not based on a deindustrialisation of Europe but on the viability of Europe as an industrial location , and on industries in Europe which produce without harming the environment and which export environmental protection .
Nevertheless , I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way , because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement .
What is certain is that no wholly military solution is possible in Afghanistan .
For the former , the Committee set aside EUR 181 million , with EUR 600 million being set aside for the latter .
Now , we must bring about an export ban that enters into force before this . Otherwise , the chlor-alkali industry , which has the largest stocks of mercury in Europe , will export huge quantities of it .
Mr Esteve has presented a well-balanced document which is certainly positive whilst also taking account of all the suggestions made by the various groups
President Daul explained this by means of a letter to Commissioner Fisher-Boel .
Why do young people face so much unemployment and precariousness ?
For all these reasons , I voted in favour of the text negotiated with the Council in order to reach agreement at second reading .
Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones .
I support the proposal that set-aside be fixed at 5 % for the 1998 harvest but without reducing payments for land taken out of production .
There are obviously still shortcomings .
What do you think of the presence of 11 representatives from national central banks of the euro area on the Economic and Financial Committee ?
For five years Ireland has enjoyed an average growth of 5 % , with unemployment down from over 16 % to scarcely 4 % and a budget surplus of over 4.5 % .
This constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof .
I must point out that these countries have not met all the deficit criteria .
I think however that this Expert Group on Financial Education should have clear responsibilities and powers .
The other institutions , too , are working hard to ensure that the effects of enlargement are ironed out , and we cannot wait for these adjustments until 2004 .
Trade can be an important part of a long-term economic solution for Pakistan .
Does the Minister agree that no matter how many years before Tibet regains its freedom , no European state should recognise the illegal actions by the Chinese Government in Tibet and that the transfer of tens of thousands of non-Tibetan people into Amdo is illegal under international law ?
Mr President , item 11 of yesterday &apos;s Minutes refers to a speech I made under Rule 121 ( a ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Fourthly and lastly the efficiency of public funding for risk capital activities must be improved and it is important that public funding should not crowd out private sector investment .
Now , we know the obsession of the Commission chaired by Mr Barroso with having these impact assessments carried out regularly as part of better regulation , which it uses as a roadmap .
I therefore call on you to adopt this report , and I also ask Commissioner Frattini to do so on behalf of the citizens of Europe .
This is also one of those rare liberalisation directives which fails to specify this aspect in a detailed manner .
In other words , if we fail in a future debate to give regions and nations a place in Europe , we in fact further separatism .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our financial forecasts for the years 2000 to 2006 , upon which our cohesion policy depends , will be decided in March next year , according to the Cardiff Summit , after the effects of the German elections have been put into perspective .
In my opinion , the Lampedusa issueshould not have been marked down for debate because it is a matter of bilateral agreements between Italy and Libya and the enforcement of Italian laws that do not contravene the EU Treaties .
Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency , under its control , which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases ?
If we can reach agreement on this point , then I think we will have solved the problem .
So that the Canadian and European markets will become more competitive and more secure , and so that product-approval procedures will become shorter and simpler , I am voting in favour of the proposal in question .
I would stress that not all foods can or will be irradiated .
It has shown a willingness to look at other areas also .
The Commission has already determined other substances ; as Mrs Doyle said , they were confined to three and , as far as I know , this has not changed since .
The increased power of a transnational financial capitalism in which capital movements and speculations are more important than real trade in goods is causing serious imbalances , chaos and crisis , while inequalities between and within countries are increasing .
It has not just listed one human rights violation after another in a given country but has adopted a comprehensive approach and policy , which the Council very much appreciates .
And what is more , if justice is to be implemented efficiently and with respect for the rights of individuals it must also remain close to the people .
They have the ambition and the capacity to grow and to become the &apos; stars &apos; of tomorrow .
This statute does not yet confer European legal personality , but the financing sees us taking the first step , with the second step , in the form of an actual European statute , perhaps yet to come .
By that , are you saying that you would be prepared to make greater use of some of the dairy management tools that are at your disposal , such as export refunds , aid to private storage and intervention ?
Yesterday there was a disgraceful Communist demonstration in the courtyard of the Tower .
We have to do more in the fight against terrorism , but without suppressing the rights of those under investigation and those who have been charged .
Does the Commission regard Prime Minister Tariceanu ’ s concession to give Romanian farmers financial help with the purchase of tractors from the factory in Brasov as an infringement of the EU ’ s competition directives ?
What is the Commission &apos;s current view of the scientific and political debate in Spain over the estimates of the minimum ecological flow of the Ebro river to its delta after the Ebro transfer ?
We need to make sure that they are implemented by everyone .
Sadly , I consider that the only way to keep drugs away from sportsmen is to decommercialise sport .
It has just been revealed that the Minister for Agriculture from his party in the United Kingdom has not even been in dialogue with his opposite number in France , which is ridiculous when you consider the way tempers are getting raised in the process of this trade war .
Accession to this area would be open to surrounding countries that fulfil the basic Copenhagen criteria of being democratic , having market economies and respecting human rights .
The Doha Development Round was not worthy of its name .
I would , therefore , invite Parliament to continue to support the transfer of the administrative aspects of customs cooperation which are currently under Title 6 of the Treaty from the third pillar to the Community &apos;s sphere .
As you will realise , that is a binding statement , committing the United States to a certain kind of conduct .
We can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging countries , China in particular , which are winning contracts with rock-bottom prices in the countries of the Union , without regard for social rights and legislation on State aid , whereas the markets of these countries remain inaccessible to European companies .
I doubt whether I would be within my rights to ask the national parliaments of our partner countries to respond to the country strategy papers .
Today &apos;s debate in this Assembly has shown that Parliament and the Commission are to a large extent agreed on how the battle should be fought .
All three institutions will need to show goodwill and make sacrifices and compromises if this arrangement is to work , but it is a prize well worth fighting for because the single market in securities will yield many benefits for the people we are elected to represent .
The United States , in a different context , has being referring to the currency situation in China , namely the Chinese peg , which United States commentators are saying is compounding the situation regarding exports from China .
Mr President , Mr Kallas , Mr López Garrido , in this case , we have seen that nature really is more powerful than any of the technologies available to us .
It is the result of a construction in which the Member States and the Commission bear the main responsibility : the Maastricht criteria in the Stability and Growth Pact - which has of course already been watered down under Commissioner Almunia &apos;s leadership - the deficit procedure , the clear statistical data and the independence of the European Central Bank .
In order to counter the proliferation of refusals of approval , it would be of great assistance if the Court of Auditors were to publish them in future in its annual report .
It is asymmetric , limited to a few rare sectors , such as transport , communication and finance and in fact only concerns the OECD countries plus a dozen more or less developing countries , whereas the majority of third world countries remain under-developed .
A mistake has nonetheless crept into our opinion .
He is now dead , and what the opposition , the democratic movement , is calling for is that we should take economic sanctions .
When we point out areas in which Kosovo &apos;s leaders need to improve , for example with regard to the protection of minorities , this is because we are serious when we say that we will stand by Kosovo in its efforts to create a democratic society . A democratic society with respect for minorities , coexisting peacefully with its neighbouring countries .
Therefore we can agree to the amendment proposed by Parliament that certain fireworks do not fall under the directive if they are produced by manufacturers for their own use and if their use by the manufacturer himself has been approved by the respective Member State .
Some would say : &apos; So what ?
Member of the Commission . Mr President , the Commission will continue to encourage the Council in all appropriate fora to make progress on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third country nationals and to intensify negotiations with the European Parliament on this proposal , with a view to reaching an agreement by the end of 2007 .
I think that a functioning European farming industry and a functioning European ecosystem need suitable support for our beekeepers , which is why I ask the House to throw its full weight behind the Lulling report .
May I also thank Commissioner Špidla for being here today in place of Commissioner Figeľ , who is travelling outside Europe .
That needs to be decided in the release directive .
It is illogical to deplore the closure of a Renault works while accepting total liberalization elsewhere .
Mr President , on a point of order and to clarify what I said earlier on , during the vote on the period of reflection , in the split vote relating to paragraph 2 of Amendment 2 , you requested a roll-call vote but then changed your mind and said the first part of that split vote would be checked .
People taking part in aviation sports in Austria and in other Member States are confronted with the fact that vitally important sets of rules for such sports are only available in English .
For the rest , colleagues on the board of the fund take the same view .
The immediate measures are those proposed by the Commission for the 1996 , 1997 and 1998 wine years , but they are merely a stopgap .
The references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States , but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice .
I have no answer to your specific question as to how that matter was concluded , but I nevertheless believe that wrong remains wrong .
In this context , I would indeed welcome what you say in paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution , namely that policy must remain based on Article 85 .
The ministers decided in Pörtschach to schedule a meeting in Tampere in the second half of the year , which will help focus strong attention on internal security in the year 1999 .
In the Commission report of 14 March this year , ( COM ( 2000 ) 147 ) , the Commission refers specifically to the development of some kind of cooperation system between the outermost regions and the ACP countries .
You cannot call on the Commissioner to stand firm on issues that are not entirely within his control .
I am thinking of the European External Action Service .
Unfortunately , over the past couple of weeks , the Council has clearly stated that it is not prepared to adopt draft amendments from the second reading .
We should call for the release of Vietnamese political prisoners who have been imprisoned because they have legally and peacefully exercised their freedom of opinion , press and religion .
At this point I should therefore like to thank all of those who give time , patience , energy and love and make sacrifices for those who need their help .
Another important point in the agreement is that businesses themselves will have to pay their invoices within 60 days , unless agreed otherwise between the parties on terms that are not unfair to the creditor .
Could you please confirm that Jean-Marie Le Pen , a Member of this House , has indeed received the selection of instruments from the Treaties which includes the Joint Declaration on Racism and Xenophobia of 11 June 1986 ?
China is a new emerging power , and we do not want to prevent that , but we object to a form of nationalism that is developing a certain degree of aggressiveness , particularly in that region in Asia .
It seems to me that , in a healthy democracy , there can be the opportunity to vote . That is what I believe , and I am not offending Parliament when I tell it to reach a verdict , while I perhaps regret the fact that this procedure does not allow it to reach a verdict on a text that has been improved – I have no hesitation in saying this – by the committee .
Let this happy intermission be an example to us ; it showed us that Europe and the entire world can understand differences in a climate of equality , harmony and mutual respect .
The uncertainty could have led project managers to interrupt the running of operational programmes , which had to be avoided at all costs .
As the United States is now at the forefront of clinical and pharmacological research , it has become a model of contemporary society in several respects . That country has had extremely successful legislation on orphan medicinal products since 1983 .
People who are really persecuted are refused the status of refugee , on the grounds that their persecutors are not Government agents , and the Council ratified this restrictive interpretation in a resolution of March 1996 .
We do not envisage opposition to reforming the main policies on expenditure . Rather , it is a case of stressing the importance of keeping to the agreed timetable , and therefore following a different course from that set for the enlargement negotiations .
What is vital now is that millions of refugees should be helped to return to living conditions worthy of human beings , to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life , which means not just food and drinking water , demining and the return of land to its owners , but most of all ensuring their physical security .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you will find it more difficult to achieve the necessary compromises at European level if the mood within Germany is different .
I think that the age limit of 25 should be raised to 30 and that the age limit for older employees should be dropped from 55 to 50 , because society relies on both , young people entering employment and older people remaining in employment .
The additionality rule can be met in various ways and yet the government has done nothing .
Let us give it another name , because it resonates with other implications .
This is also true of the contributions to environmental organisations .
Nor should we forget the Mediterranean aspect of the Union , the investment in the fruit and vegetable sector which will have to compete with the substantial need for economic aid of large countries dependent on agriculture .
The quality of interventions within the framework of Community aid depends on the strategies and ideas of the Member States .
The people have been bypassed , but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people .
The amendments we have tabled emphasise our opposition and the basis of principle which leads us to reject any attempt to create a situation in which the management of pension fund reserves is liberalised and uncontrolled , leaving their assets to be gambled away on the stock markets .
It has not , however , been demonstrated , and still less proved , that the most suitable and effective method of coping with these breaches of the law is to set up a further European agency or common EU coastguard .
How should the challenges of the future be tackled ?
The money that is available should be spent on the needs of our 375 million people and on the protection of our environment , not on the European Parliament as an institution .
I think we need to remain very aware of that when we make a balanced assessment of our negotiations with Turkey .
I want to highlight two of these points here .
I do not intend to list these in detail at the moment ; we can do that at the second reading .
In the framework of the work carried out on this directive , we now await the initiatives of the Commission and the discussions in Council so that this error can be rectified .
Commitment to education should not be seen as a cost , but rather as an investment in the future .
With larger vessels it is often possible to put out to sea on more days , and sometimes that does not result in greater tonnage , but does lead to more actual fishing .
As a forward-thinking European , you guided Portugal with a sure hand on the road to European Union membership .
One person said that it was fortunate that no referendum was to take place , for in that case it would also fail to be adopted in his own country , Portugal .
On the one hand , there is the rule that since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999 the Council has been responsible for establishing the rules on EU visa policy .
In several chapters the Court criticizes the management of Community subsidies .
The absence of European patent legislation , for instance , is a hindrance for small businesses in particular to make the most of the opportunities of the internal market . Small businesses do not have the necessary resources to register their new developments .
I would like to stress the need to invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and to provide support - in addition to one-off aid - for communities &apos; own disaster-preparedness capabilities .
The first is that the Commission should make it possible for the Council to put forward a supporting regulation for EURO-4 to Parliament without the risk of accusations of state support .
As far as technology is concerned , there is still more to do .
It was not just to please the European Union and ensure that it became a member .
A journalist from the most influential newspaper in Poland asked me , &apos; What do you people do in the European Parliament ?
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Togo ( 1 ) .
I am aware of the need to be sensitive as regards national procedural rules .
Amendments Nos 7 , 8 and 15 do not precisely correspond to the objectives of the proposal and , therefore , it is not appropriate to accept them .
The information must be shown prominently on the label , not in tiny letters in the list of ingredients .
I thought that a useful addition by Parliament and even the Commission was in agreement with it .
The final matter concerns security .
As I indicated earlier , that was not the case ; I reacted while I was there and the Commission responded well to this issue .
As the Social Democrat Group , we are right behind the rapporteur and also voted in favour in the committee as a result of our conviction on the matter .
The EU must make it quite clear that while we may have different opinions on other issues and still carry on with the agenda , this specific topic is a priority for the EU .
There were some issues raised in the debate that I will not comment on individually at this time because they are of a very specific and organisational nature , and I believe that each and every one of them is worthy of an expert assessment as to its merit .
Aid for research , innovation and education is an essential measure for ensuring a labour market for all .
In this context , it is clear to me that Palestine must be a viable state , and that we will therefore have to continue to provide humanitarian aid .
Among the very many thoughts expressed , I add my own two in favour of the experiment .
I am of the firm conviction that , given the colonial history of these countries , Europe has a major obligation to this region .
There are three Finno-Ugric nation states in the European Union , and in addition there are three million people representing the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia .
Monetary union is the final cornerstone of economic integration .
Our group would therefore like to keep the debate and vote on oral questions and motions for resolutions in one part-session , and put the association agreements back to another part-session .
Now , after an eclipse that has lasted for many decades , Italy can contribute towards the future of the Union with an appropriate role .
We have to rely to a certain extent on parliamentary fair play .
More often , however , state aid has been a means of protecting weak regions , disadvantaged professional groups and vital public services , or of protecting society against the effects of major economic crises .
in writing . - Conservative MEPs abstained on the final vote on the Mănescu report for the following reasons .
The discussion on reproductive health and rights dominated the last days of the summit .
The European Union needs – by which I mean that the Member States need – to take action , action in the form of information campaigns aimed in particular at the victims , but also in the existing structures , such as the establishments where police officers , social workers and the judiciary are trained and in similar places , along with more cooperation with NGOs and the executive .
Certainly we want to see European harmonisation in the area of damage caused to the environment , which is often cross-border in nature , but it is also necessary that the directive should represent serious progress .
Finally , I hope that the Member States respect the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference to put the matter of legal immigration to qualified majority voting and to codecision .
If , as it has been asked to do in European Parliament resolutions , Turkey really wants to help resolve the Cyprus problem on the basis of the UN Secretary-General &apos;s most recent plan , then it will start backing off in its foreign policy as well .
If this policy remains unchanged so will the state of affairs , and the situation in town centres will steadily worsen .
First of all , we think a policy should set itself objectives that lend it significance , like the development of a sound European industrial base , increasing employment , especially for young people , and the emergence of European industrial champions able to act as standard bearers for the ‘ Made in Europe ’ brand .
In 1996 when the new Socialist government came to power in Portugal , policies changed , Madrid moved into line and , at the Dublin Council , the European Union approved the new emphasis on multimodal transport with which we happen to agree .
